I am thrilled and proud to receive a 
[mentoring award](https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2023/04/17/margaret-cuninggim-womens-center-presents-annual-awards-to-five-vanderbilt-community-members/) 
from the 
[Margaret Cuninggim Women's Center](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/womenscenter/) 
at Vanderbilt, recognizing my 
mentorship, support, and advocacy for women at Vanderbilt, especially in 
STEM.
One of the nominating letters described me as
"bring[ing] a truly unique kindness and deliberate commitment to equity and 
inclusion to his mentorship."

Mentoring students and junior faculty colleagues is the most rewarding part of
my work, and out of all the recognition I have received, this award is the
most meaningful.

Transgender and gender nonconforming (TGnC) people are a primary target of the Trump administration. Multiple executive orders seek to erase TGnC protections; mandate denial of gender identity; and ban diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Changes to federal funding policies related to TGnC individuals and DEI threaten to curtail academic diversity and freedom. Institutions have been hesitant to resist, but for many TGnC scientists---especially TGnC individuals of color, immigrants, and those with disabilities---invisibility is not an option. Anticipatory obedience, and even passive allyship, is insufficient; institutions must abandon neutrality and defend targeted communities to minimize further harm. As queer and TGnC scientists, we call on researchers at all levels---from undergraduates to university presidents---to take direct, consistent, and rapid action.

title: Participatory simulations of urban flooding for learning and decision support
---
Flood-control measures, such as levees and floodwalls, can backfire and increase risks of disastrous floods by giving the public a false sense of security and thus encouraging people to build valuable property in high-risk locations. More generally, nonlinear interactions between human land-use and natural processes can produce unexpected emergent phenomena in coupled human-natural systems (CHNS). We describe a participatory agent-based simulation of coupled urban development and flood risks and discuss the potential of this simulation to help educate a wide range of the public-from middle- and high-school students to public officials-about emergence in CHNS and present results from two pilot studies.

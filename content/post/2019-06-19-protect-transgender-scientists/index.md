I am co-author on a 
[letter to _Science_](/publications/sinnott_armstrong_2025_trans_scientists/) 
discussing the need to protect
transgender and gender-nonconforming (GnC) scientists in the face of 
politicized attacks by the Trump administration.

Executive orders and changes to federal funding policies are both 
removing civil-rights protections for trans and GnC people in STEM, 
such as protection against discrimination in hiring and promotion,
as well as removing funding for efforts to improve trans and GnC
representation in STEM disciplines, identify best practices for 
promoting EDI, and track progress on diversity.
New policies on passports and visas threaten to make it dangerous or 
impossible for trans scientists, both citizens and non-citizens, to
travel internationally.

Many universities and other research organizations have responded to 
these government actions by eliminating EDI programs, adopting a 
policy of silence about LGBTQ rights on campus, and rendering 
trans and GnC people in their organizations invisible.

We argue that institutional silence, political neutrality, and 
anticipatory obedience with attacks on EDI and on trans and GnC
people's rights is actively harmful. Institutions of research and 
higher learning must take positive actions to advocate for and to 
protect the rights and equal opportunities of trans and GnC scientists.

Mike Vandenbergh and I have a new paper out, in the journal 
_Energy Research & Social Science_, on our three-part framework for assessing 
the impacts of private cliamte governance.

<!-- more -->
We discussed our three-part framework in previous writing, such as
["Accounting for Political Feasibility"](/publications/gilligan_2014_political_feasibility/), 
["Beyond Gridlock"](/publications/vandenbergh_2015_beyond_gridlock/),
and 
[_Beyond Politics_](https://beyondpoliticsbook.com).
Here, we discuss some practical steps toward applying the framework to assessing
the prospects and potential impacts of private climate governance and some of 
the research needs and priorities for using our framework more broadly.

In this article, we emphasize the valuable and pioneering work 
[Angel Hsu](https://publicpolicy.unc.edu/people/angel-hsu/) and
her colleagues have done to identify and recommend 
[best practices](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-018-0338-z) 
for assessing non-state initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to 
allocate impacts when multiple actors (e.g., state and local governments, or 
governments and private actors) contribute to joint or overlapping initiatives.

We conclude that the potential for private cliamte governance is even greater 
than we estimated in our book, 
[_Beyond Politics_](https://beyondpoliticsbook.com),
and that methods and data exist to make reasonable estimates of this potential
today. However, many research challenges remain both for developing more 
sophisticated approaches for treating _initiative feasibility_ (the prospect for
a proposed public or private policy initiative to be enacted and implemented)
and for producing systematic data on what the business sector is currently doing
to cut its emissions and for calculating the _technical potential_ for future 
initiatives.

One particularly hopeful result that we report in this paper is that we estimate
that the adoption of energy-efficient light bulbs by U.S. homes has reduced 
greenhouse gas emissions in the residential sector by almost 130 million metric
tons per year of CO2 equivalent (detailed calculations are available in the 
[supporting information](https://github.com/jonathan-g/private_governance_framework_si)).

# Coastal SEES Collaborative Research: Multi-Scale Modeling and Observations of Landscape Dynamics, Mass Balance, and Network Connectivity for a Sustainable Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta

Andre Leroux, at the University of Texas Austin, made a short film about my
collaborative interdisciplinary research project studying the changing river 
systems of Bangladesh and the prospects for sustainable management of the delta
in the face of climate change and sea-level rise.

The film is being shown at the 
[AGU Cinema](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm19/meetingapp.cgi/Session/94190) 
at the 
[2019 Fall Meeting](https://www.agu.org/fall-meeting)

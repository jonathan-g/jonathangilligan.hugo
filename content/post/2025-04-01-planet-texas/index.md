In February, I gave the opening keynote talk at the Planet Texas 2050
symposium at the University of Texas Austin. 
UT has uploaded 
a video of my talk,
["Sustainability across the University: Expanding the Disciplinary
Range of Teaching, Scholarship, and Artistic Expression Responding to
Environmental Change"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajaNGYTsbXA),
to YouTube.

The subject of the talk
was why deeply interdisciplinary engagement across the entire university,
including natural and social sciences, engineering, public policy, 
humanities, and the arts, is critical to addressing the challenges of
climate change and sustainability. To illustrate this, I discussed the
history of 20 years of deeply interdisciplinary teaching, research, and
artistic expression about climate change and sustainability at
Vanderbilt.

I have a [new paper](/publications/raff_2023_sediment/), led by Jess Raff, 
that analyzes sediment transport and sediment budgets 
in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta, and assesses the implications of 
sediment flow for sustainability in the face of sea-level rise and the 
diversion and damming of major rivers.

Sediment that originates in the Himalayan mountains and is transported to the 
Bengal coast by the large rivers in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) 
river system,
and a large fraction of this sediment is deposited on land along the coast,
where it can raise the land and offset sea-level rise.

Many hydrological models suggest that global warming will strengthen the 
South Asian monsoon, and predict that this strengthening would bring a lot more
sediment to the coast. 

We used empirical observations of sediment deposition throughout the 
Holocene (roughly the last 10,000 years) to validate these models and strengthen
our confidence in the predicitons of increased sediment transport in a warmer
climate. This has the potential to raise the land as sea-level rises, thus 
improving the sustainability and resilience of coastal communities and 
avoiding catastrophic inundation of the coast that could
displace millions of people.

However, plans to divert large amounts of water from rivers in the GBM system,
or to build dams across the rivers, could substantially reduce sediment flow,
and this could endanger the coastal region and the people who live there.

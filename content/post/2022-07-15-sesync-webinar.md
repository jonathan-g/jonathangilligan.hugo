In June, I gave the keynote talk for a 
[webinar and panel discussion](https://www.sesync.org/news-events/modeling-behavioral-change-socio-environmental-systems)
at 
[the National Socioenvironmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC)](https://www.sesync.org/) 
about incorporating
behavior change into socio-environmental systems models.
The video of the event has now been posted to 
[SESYNC's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNationalSocioEnvironmentalSynthesisCenter)

Expanding the development and use of socio-environmental system (SES) models is 
critical to solving urgent problems situated at the human-nature interface. 
Substantial progress is being made, but modeling challenges associated with 
a range of diverse issues remain. This is the fifth in a series of webcasts 
based on my 2020 article with Sondoss Elsawah and others, 
â€œ[Eight grand challenges in socio-environmental systems modelling](https://doi.org/10.18174/sesmo.2020a16226)."

This webinar and panel discussion event focused on the critical challenge of 
incorporating the human dimension in SES modeling. My talk presented
the state of the art in modeling behavioral change, fundamental scientific 
challenges, and promising research directions. 

The other panelists, who spoke and provided detail about how their work 
addresses the challenges of bringing realistic human behavior into 
socioenvironmental systems modeling were:

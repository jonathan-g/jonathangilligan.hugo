They took their season's pay in bags of rice, which they will use to feed their families until the local harvest comes in. This migration was an adaptation to the loss of local agricultural production following cyclone Aila, which devastated the Polder in 2009."

I have a [new paper](/publications/best_2025_Migration_ABM/), 
with [Kelsea Best](https://www.kelseabestresearch.com/) and 
[Bishawjit Mallick](https://www.uu.nl/staff/BMallick),
in which we used pattern-oriented agent-based modeling to study
environmentally-driven migration in rural Bangladesh and found that
economic inequality in rural villages plays a crucial role.

Environmental stresses, such as floods, droughts, and severe storms,
can play important roles in displacing populations and affecting
both temporary and permanent migration away from people's home 
communities. However, extensive research consistently finds that 
the connection between disasters or other environmental events and
migration is not a simple matter of the event directly causing migration.
Rather, environmental stress is best considered as one among many factors
affecting population movements.

Additionally, for several years Bishawjit Mallick has been arguing that
greater attention should be paid to 
[environmental non-migration](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-023-01516-1): 
active decisions not to migrate in the face of environmental stress. 

To better understand the interactions between environmental and other 
forces in shaping people's decisions whether to remain in their home 
communities or leave, we turned to 
[_pattern-oriented agent-based modeling_](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2024.110853).
This method, which originated in ecological modeling, seeks to identify
underlying mechanisms driving complex phenomena through a "multiscope"
approach that identifies multiple qualitative patterns that a system
exhibits at different scales, and evaluates models by their ability to
simultaneously reproduce all the target patterns.

## Identifying Patterns

The three of us have been studying migration in Bangladesh for a decade,
including extensive collaborations with 
[Amanda Carrico](https://www.colorado.edu/envs/amanda-carrico)
and
[Katharine Donato](https://isim.georgetown.edu/profile/katharine-m-donato/),
who lead the ongoing 
[Bangladesh Environment and Migraiton Survey](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/38846).
We have long been intrigued by 
[unexpected patterns in environmentally-driven 
migration](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1115944109) 
discovered by [Clark Gray](https://clarkgray.web.unc.edu/) 
and [Valerie Mueller](https://sites.google.com/view/vamueller/home),
in which:

* Migration away from rural villages in Bangladesh are driven more by
  disasters that cause farmers to lose their crops than by disasters,
  such as floods, that affect other aspects of people's lives and 
  communities.
* When disasters cause crop losses that affect only a small fraction
  of a community, out-migration falls, compared to years when there
  is no disaster, but when the disaster affects the crops of more than
  about 20% of a community, out-migration rises.
* Households that are directly affected by a disaster are less likely
  to migrate away than households that are not directly affected.

Gray and Mueller's findings are well-suited to study with pattern-oriented
modeling, so we developed an agent-based model to investigate whether a
simple economic model of a village could explain them.

Our model sought to reproduce the latter two patterns: (1) as a
disaster affects more and more of a community, migration drops at first,
and then rises when the scope of the disaster crosses a threshold, and
(2) households that are directly affected by the disaster are less likely
to migrate.

## What We Did (Simple Overview)

We built our model on the hypothesis that households make decisions whether
to send one or more members of their extended family to seek work outside
the village, and do so based on whether they expect that they will see a
net economic benefit from the remittances the migrant sends back, after
paying for the cost of migration.

Our model simulates a village economy that provides both agricultural
and non-agricultural opportunities for income. Households may have arable
land on which they grow crops, and they may hire workers to help cultivate
their fields and household members may seek income by working on others' 
fields.

When a disaster causes crop losses, a household will no longer employ
wage-laborers on its own fields, and members may seek to replace the lost
income by working on others' fields, and they may also seek non-farm employment.

We used empirical data from household surveys to assign values for most 
parameters that describe the village and the households, but we had to 
guess at two that were not addressed in surveys: the cost of migrating
and seeking work elsewhere, and the expected value of remittances that 
migrants send back.

## What We Found

After running the model tens of thousands of times, with many different
combinations of estimates for the cost of migration, remittances from migrants,
and the distribution of household land ownership, we found a surprising 
result:

As long as our model accurately represented the inequality of land-ownership
within a village, it robustly reproduced the two target patterns from 
Gray and Mueller's work. By "robustly", we mean that model reproduced
both patterns in the vast majority of simulation runs for 91% of the 
values we tested for the unknown parameters describing the expected 
cost and benefit of migration.

```

However, when we ran the model using distributions of 
land-ownership that did not represent what we knew from household 
surveys---especially distributions in which inequality in land-ownership
was much less than the surveys revealed---the model performed 
poorly at reproducing the observed patterns.

Thus, we learned that a simple hypothesis that households make migration
decisions based mostly upon the expected economic benefit is sufficient
to explain observed patterns of migration, but only if the model gets
the economic inequality correct. 

This reveals that economic inequality within villages appears to be far
more important than we expected at influencing decisions about migration
after a disaster.


## Details of Our Model

Our model determined employment using a continuous double-auction 
labor market that matches households seeking workers with workers 
seeking employment. 

Each year, each household considers whether to send one or more members
away to seek employment outside the village. They do this based on the 
opportunities available within the village, the cost of migration,
and the expected benefit of migration in the form of remittances returned by 
the migrant.

Household size, wealth, income opportunities, and land-holdings were initialized
from random distributions parameterized by empirical data collected by 
Carrico and Donato's BEMS survey, which covered roughly 1,300 households in 10 communities.
Two variables that were crucial for our model were not collected by the survey:
the cost of migrating and the average remittance returned by migrants. 

To address our uncertainty about these two variables, we ran the model 100 times
for each of 150 random combinations of plausible cost and remittance.
We used machine-learning methods to identify what combinations of parameters
can reproduce both patterns at once.

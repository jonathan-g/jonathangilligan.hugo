  caption: "Migrants returning to Polder 32 in Dakop Upazilla, Khulna in May 2012, after spending a season working on paddy farms 100 km away. They took their season's pay in bags of rice, which they will use to feed their families until the local harvest comes in. This migration was an adaptation to the loss of local agricultural production following cyclone Aila, which devastated the Polder in 2009."

<p>I have a <a href="/publications/best_2025_Migration_ABM/">new paper</a>,
with <a href="https://www.kelseabestresearch.com/">Kelsea Best</a> and
<a href="https://www.uu.nl/staff/BMallick">Bishawjit Mallick</a>,
in which we used pattern-oriented agent-based modeling to study
environmentally-driven migration in rural Bangladesh and found that
economic inequality in rural villages plays a crucial role.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Environmental stresses, such as floods, droughts, and severe storms,
can play important roles in displacing populations and affecting
both temporary and permanent migration away from people’s home
communities. However, extensive research consistently finds that
the connection between disasters or other environmental events and
migration is not a simple matter of the event directly causing migration.
Rather, environmental stress is best considered as one among many factors
affecting population movements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]hey did not react blindly to the furies of nature.
What appears to be natural takes work: policies and legislation,
chance and intention, technology and
energy—not famine alone—combined to “push” migration across the
Bay of Bengal. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-amrith-2013">Amrith 2013, 114</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as the environment is only one among many factors that drive
migration, migration is also only one among many possible responses
to environmental change. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-walsham-2010">Walsham 2010</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, for several years Bishawjit Mallick has been arguing that
greater attention should be paid to
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-023-01516-1">environmental non-migration</a>:
active decisions not to migrate in the face of environmental stress.</p>
<p>To better understand the interactions between environmental and other
forces in shaping people’s decisions whether to remain in their home
communities or leave, we turned to
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2024.110853"><em>pattern-oriented agent-based modeling</em></a>.
This method, which originated in ecological modeling, seeks to identify
underlying mechanisms driving complex phenomena through a “multiscope”
approach that identifies multiple qualitative patterns that a system
exhibits at different scales, and evaluates models by their ability to
simultaneously reproduce all the target patterns.</p>

<h2>Identifying Patterns</h2>
<p>The three of us have been studying migration in Bangladesh for a decade,
including extensive collaborations with
<a href="https://www.colorado.edu/envs/amanda-carrico">Amanda Carrico</a>
and
<a href="https://isim.georgetown.edu/profile/katharine-m-donato/">Katharine Donato</a>,
who lead the ongoing
<a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/38846">Bangladesh Environment and Migraiton Survey</a>.
We have long been intrigued by
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1115944109">unexpected patterns in environmentally-driven
migration</a>
discovered by <a href="https://clarkgray.web.unc.edu/">Clark Gray</a>
and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/vamueller/home">Valerie Mueller</a>,
in which:</p>
<ul>
<li>Migration away from rural villages in Bangladesh are driven more by
disasters that cause farmers to lose their crops than by disasters,
such as floods, that affect other aspects of people’s lives and
communities.</li>
<li>When disasters cause crop losses that affect only a small fraction
of a community, out-migration falls, compared to years when there
is no disaster, but when the disaster affects the crops of more than
about 20% of a community, out-migration rises.</li>
<li>Households that are directly affected by a disaster are less likely
to migrate away than households that are not directly affected.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gray and Mueller’s findings are well-suited to study with pattern-oriented
modeling, so we developed an agent-based model to investigate whether a
simple economic model of a village could explain them.</p>
<p>Our model sought to reproduce the latter two patterns: (1) as a
disaster affects more and more of a community, migration drops at first,
and then rises when the scope of the disaster crosses a threshold, and
(2) households that are directly affected by the disaster are less likely
to migrate.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-we-did-simple-overview" class="section level2">
<h2>What We Did (Simple Overview)</h2>
<p>We built our model on the hypothesis that households make decisions whether
to send one or more members of their extended family to seek work outside
the village, and do so based on whether they expect that they will see a
net economic benefit from the remittances the migrant sends back, after
paying for the cost of migration.</p>
<p>Our model simulates a village economy that provides both agricultural
and non-agricultural opportunities for income. Households may have arable
land on which they grow crops, and they may hire workers to help cultivate
their fields and household members may seek income by working on others’
fields.</p>
<p>When a disaster causes crop losses, a household will no longer employ
wage-laborers on its own fields, and members may seek to replace the lost
income by working on others’ fields, and they may also seek non-farm employment.</p>
<p>We used empirical data from household surveys to assign values for most
parameters that describe the village and the households, but we had to
guess at two that were not addressed in surveys: the cost of migrating
and seeking work elsewhere, and the expected value of remittances that
migrants send back.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-we-found" class="section level2">
<h2>What We Found</h2>
<p>After running the model tens of thousands of times, with many different
combinations of estimates for the cost of migration, remittances from migrants,
and the distribution of household land ownership, we found a surprising
result:</p>
<p>As long as our model accurately represented the inequality of land-ownership
within a village, it robustly reproduced the two target patterns from
Gray and Mueller’s work. By “robustly”, we mean that model reproduced
both patterns in the vast majority of simulation runs for 91% of the
values we tested for the unknown parameters describing the expected
cost and benefit of migration.</p>
{{% figure src="/post/img/inequality-migration/fig-1.png" title="Figure 1: Variation of migration versus community impact factor" alt="Figure showing the variation in the number of migrations versus the fraction of the community affected. As the fraction of the community affected by a disaster rises from 0 to around 20%, the number of migrations falls, but when more than 20% of the community is affected, the number of migrations rises." caption="Variation in the number of migrations following a disaster, versus the fraction of the community affected (community impact-factor). The solid black line represents the mean from 13,7000 simulation runs, and the gray area represents the 95% confidence interval over those runs." %}}
<p>However, when we ran the model using distributions of
land-ownership that did not represent what we knew from household
surveys—especially distributions in which inequality in land-ownership
was much less than the surveys revealed—the model performed
poorly at reproducing the observed patterns.</p>
<p>Thus, we learned that a simple hypothesis that households make migration
decisions based mostly upon the expected economic benefit is sufficient
to explain observed patterns of migration, but only if the model gets
the economic inequality correct.</p>
<p>This reveals that economic inequality within villages appears to be far
more important than we expected at influencing decisions about migration
after a disaster.</p>

<div id="details-of-our-model" class="section level2">
<h2>Details of Our Model</h2>
<p>Our model determined employment using a continuous double-auction
labor market that matches households seeking workers with workers
seeking employment.</p>
<p>Each year, each household considers whether to send one or more members
away to seek employment outside the village. They do this based on the
opportunities available within the village, the cost of migration,
and the expected benefit of migration in the form of remittances returned by
the migrant.</p>
<p>Household size, wealth, income opportunities, and land-holdings were initialized
from random distributions parameterized by empirical data collected by
Carrico and Donato’s BEMS survey, which covered roughly 1,300 households in 10 communities.
Two variables that were crucial for our model were not collected by the survey:
the cost of migrating and the average remittance returned by migrants.</p>
<p>To address our uncertainty about these two variables, we ran the model 100 times
for each of 150 random combinations of plausible cost and remittance.
We used machine-learning methods to identify what combinations of parameters
can reproduce both patterns at once.</p>

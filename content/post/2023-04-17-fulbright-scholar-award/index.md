I am very excited to announce that I have been selected for a Fulbright Scholar
Award, which will allow me to spend a large part of the next academic year at
the [University of Calgary](https://www.ucalgary.ca/)'s 
[Werklund School of Education](https://werklund.ucalgary.ca/)
as the Fulbright Canada Research Chair in Digital Technologies and 
Sustainability. 
I will work with Professors 
[Pratim Sengupta](https://www.m3lab.org/), 
[Marie-Claire Shanahan](https://boundaryvision.com/), and 
[Ariel Ducey](https://www.arielducey.com/) 
to explore new possibilities for using interactive computer models
in the context of public art installations to engage the public with climate
change through model representations of people's narratives of the way 
environmental change is affecting their lives and their communities.

## About _The Scarlet Letter_ 

Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel, _The Scarlet Letter_ is one of the most frequently 
assigned novels in U.S. high schools, but it is often taught as a simple 
morality tale about sin and hypocrisy, ignoring the deep and radical feminism of 
Hawthorne's writing. Hawthorne published the novel in 1850, two years after the 
Seneca Falls Convention for women's rights, and at the height of the feminist 
abolitionist movement led by Lucretia Mott and others. Ten years earlier, 
Hawthorne had joined the idealistic Brook Farm commune, which sought to 
establish a more just and equal way of living in which women would be freed 
from patriarchal strictures. 

In _The Scarlet Letter_, Hawthorne writes Hester Prynne as uncommonly perceptive 
and strong (Hester had "so much power to do, and power to sympathize, that many 
people refused to interpret the scarlet A by its original signification. They 
said that it meant Able; so strong was Hester Prynne, with a woman’s strength.") 
and he concludes the novel with a vision that "at some brighter period, when the 
world should have grown ripe for it, in Heaven’s own time, a new truth would be 
revealed, in order to establish the whole relation between man and woman on a 
surer ground of mutual happiness." Hawthorne's Hester sees the injustice of a 
patriarchal society, but the clarity of her vision (like "moonlight, in a 
familiar room, falling so white upon the carpet, and showing all its figures so 
distinctly,—making every object so minutely visible, yet so unlike a morning or 
noontide visibility") comes at the price of having to live outside of that 
society, set apart both by her own choice and the will of the patriarchs 
("such a patriarchal body of veterans," in Hawthorne's words, full of 
"patriarchal privilege.").

In adapting _The Scarlet Letter_ for an age in which women once again challenge 
a new generation of patriarchs, we chose to rotate the tale and present it from 
a different perspective, that of Hester and Dimmesdale's daughter Pearl, whom 
Hester raised to become a strong and independent woman, someone who might live 
a life of freedom and equality that escaped Hester and Dimmesdale.


> Just as Arthur Miller’s _The Crucible_ was reflective of a poignant moment 
> in American history with the Army-McCarthy hearings of the 1950’s, 
> _The Scarlet Letter_ directly addresses hypocrisies that remain tangible in 
> our current society. From the #MeToo movement, to gender-controlling 
> legislation, to awakening awareness of personal bias based on systemic 
> rhetoric, the conversations of gender are being brought to the forefront of 
> our consciousness and our community. 
> 
> As a play that asks questions without providing answers, this new adaptation
> from Carol Gilligan and Jonathan Gilligan masterfully weaves an old story,
> one that many are familiar with from our secondary education, into a
> current event that launches discussion, debate, and perhaps change. Finding
> ways to empower each other, ourselves, and future generations when our
> “Goodwives” and leaders feed a social media aimed toward maintaining and
> propagating societal norms can feel insurmountable, yet small steps can be
> powerful and you can contribute to either side with your choices.

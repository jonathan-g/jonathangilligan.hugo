## About _Pearl_

Translating the play _The Scarlet Letter_ to the opera _Pearl_ began with 
Grammy Nominee Sara Jobin, the first woman to conduct 
the San Francisco Opera. Sara had grown weary of the opera canon, in which 
there were few strong women, and all too often the heroine died at the end.
To remedy this, Jobin created the Different Voice Opera Project, which sponsored
the development of this opera with award-winning young composer
[Amy Scurria](https://www.amyscurria.com/)

This opera focuses on Hester Prynne, Reverend Dimmesdale, and their daughter 
Pearl, and on the changes in 
Pearl's perception of the events she witnessed as a child and what she comes 
to understand looking back on them as an adult. The challenges of living as a
strong woman under patriarchy, and the basic tensions---between 
the private and public aspects of erotic relationships, between one's role as a 
parent, as a lover, and as a citizen, and between moral codes and personal 
passion---are as fraught and important today as they were in the 
mid-seventeenth century.

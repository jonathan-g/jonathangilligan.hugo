Science, policy, history, and causes of climate change on Earth in the last 
2 million years; evidence of human impacts on climate since 1850; future 
climate change and its economic, social, and ecological consequences; economic, 
technological, and public policy responses.

This course, for undergraduate students, has two major parts:

1. The __basic scientific principles__ of the earth's climate.

1. __Human dimensions__ of climate change.

### Scientific Principles of Climate Change:


For the first half of the semester, we will focus on the scientific principles 
of climate and natural climate change in earth???s past. This will be 
mathematical, using basic algebra. We do not use calculus or other advanced 
math in this class, but you should be comfortable with simple algebraic 
equations. We will then look at climate change in the last two centuries and 
what might happen over the next several centuries. We will emphasize examining 
the scientific evidence to understand what it can and cannot tell us.

### Human Dimensions of Climate Change 

For the second half of the semester, we will focus on the ways that climate 
change is likely to affect people???s lives over the rest of this century and 
what technological responses are being considered to reduce harmful impacts.

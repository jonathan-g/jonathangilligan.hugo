Here are some projects I worked on previously:

1. Environmental stress and human migration in southwestern Bangladesh: 
   A comparison of co-evolving natural and human landscapes in a physically 
   and culturally diverse context.

1. Data-driven approaches to understanding the impacts of gentrification on 
   vulnerable populations, with a focus on air quality and access to mobility 
   and public transit.


1. Opportunities and challenges for implementing sustainable and
   resilient energy, transportation, and telecommunications
   infrastructure across the Southeastern United States, with an
   emphasis on the potential for this infrastructure to address growing
   disparities between urban and rural communities.

1. Applications of technology for training the next generation of 
   water-service operators.

1. Water Conservation in US cities: A multidisciplinary analysis of 
   hydrological, political, and social dimensions of water management and 
   conservation policy in US metropolitan areas.

1. Agricultural decision-making and adaptation to precipitation trends in 
   Sri Lanka: Studying the impacts of water stress on paddy farmers in the 
   Mahaweli River Watershed of Sri Lanka and understanding the factors that 
   facilitate or constrain adaptive responses.

Here are some projects I worked on previously:

1. Water Conservation in US cities: A multidisciplinary analysis of 
   hydrological, political, and social dimensions of water management and 
   conservation policy in US metropolitan areas.

1. Agricultural decision-making and adaptation to precipitation trends in 
   Sri Lanka: Studying the impacts of water stress on paddy farmers in the 
   Mahaweli River Watershed of Sri Lanka and understanding the factors that 
   facilitate or constrain adaptive responses.

I am currently pursuing research in three areas:

1. New directions in US climate policy: Integrating insights from 
   social and behavioral science, engineering, and legal scholarship to 
   develop pragmatic approaches that could quickly reduce greenhouse gas 
   emissions in the US during a time when major federal regulations seem 
   unlikely.
   
   * An active subset of this research focuses on the energy needs and
     associated greenhouse gas emissions from large data centers, and
     the challenges and opportunities for private-sector actions to 
     address these as generative artificial intelligence is growing 
     rapidly.

1. Application of machine learning methods to understanding the 
   risks of "forever chemicals" (PFAS, or 
   per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances) contamination in 
   surface and groundwater across Tennessee, and the implications for
   public health and burdens on community water systems.

1. Access to safe and affordable drinking water across the United 
   States, with an emphasis on environmental justice and disparities in 
   this access that socially and economically disadvantaged communities.

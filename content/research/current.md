I am currently pursuing research in six areas:

1. Environmental stress and human migration in southwestern Bangladesh: 
   A comparison of co-evolving natural and human landscapes in a physically 
   and culturally diverse context.

1. New directions in US climate policy: Integrating insights from social and 
   behavioral science, engineering, and legal scholarship to develop pragmatic 
   approaches that could quickly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the US 
   during a time when major federal regulations seem unlikely.

1. Opportunities for resilient and sustainable infrastructure in the 
   Southeastern United States and the potential for this infrastructure to 
   address growing disparities between urban and rural communities.

1. Data-driven approaches to understanding the impacts of gentrification on 
   vulnerable populations, with a focus on air quality and access to mobility 
   and public transit.

1. Applications of technology for training the next generation of water-service
   operators.

1. Access to safe and affordable drinking water across the United States,
   with an emphasis on environmental justice and disparities in this access
   that socially and economically disadvantaged communities.

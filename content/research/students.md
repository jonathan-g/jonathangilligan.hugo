Students working with me are engaged in a variety of projects to combine 
knowledge about the physical environment and social, political, and economic 
conditions.
This can include analysis of remote-sensing imagery from satellites, working 
with GIS databases, developing agent-based models, and conducting 
spatiotemporal statistical analysis.

Students write and publish papers, often as first-author, in scientific journals
and present research results at national and international conferences.

## Current Students

- [**Fernanda (Ferna) Alvarez-Carrascal**](https://lab.vanderbilt.edu/dwjlab/person/ferna-v-alvarez-carrascal-m-s/)
  is applying advanced Bayesian statistical methods to understanding 
  the geographical distribution of drinking-water contamination across
  the United States and the implications for environmental justice:
  which communities and demographic groups are most vulnerable to 
  exposure to contaminated drinking water? 
  She also studies the adoption of home solar energy and 
  household energy-efficiency improvements among Latino/a 
  households in urban and rural areas in Tennessee and Washington.
  
  Ferna is a member of the Executive Board of Vanderbilt's Turner
  Family Center for Social Ventures, and has served as a leader in 
  Vanderbilt's Project Pyramid, an interdisciplinary program that 
  combines classroom and hands-on learning experiences to engage with 
  socially conscious organizations around the world. 
  Ferna led the 2025 project, which brought Vanderbilt
  students to Colombia to work with entrepreneurs in the city of 
  Manizales developing market-based solutions for social and 
  environmental problems.

## Recently Graduated Students

- [**Kelsea Best**](https://www.kelseabestresearch.com/) 
  studied connections between environmental change,
  livelihoods, and population movement in Bangladesh. Kelsea applies 
  machine learning to survey data to identify patterns in the 
  characteristics of people who relocate and will use those insights to 
  develop agent-based models to simulate migration patterns.
  
  While she was a graduate student, Kelsea was also Principal 
  Investigator on a graduate pursuit project at the National 
  Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center. This project was a 
  graduate-student only research project for which Kelsea recruited an 
  interdisciplinary team of graduate students from universities across 
  the U.S. to work together on understanding connections between 
  climate change and gentrification along the entire Atlantic Coast of 
  the United States.
  
  As a graduate student, Kelsea won Vanderbilt's Graduate Leadership 
  Award in 2021.
  
  Kelsea is now Assistant Professor of Civil, Environmental & 
  Geodetic Engineering and Assistant Professor of City & Regional 
  Planning at The Ohio State University.

- [**Bowen He**](https://www.bowenhe.org/) 
  studied ways to use data science to promote social justice and 
  effective policymaking on the environment. 
  His principal dissertation project was developing geographical tools
  and algorithms for studying the impact of natural disasters on the 
  social fabric of neighborhoods and for assessing the geographic
  distribution of vulnerable populations at fine spatial resolution. 
  He also developed an interactive web-based application for comparing 
  the potential impacts of different policies on greenhouse gas 
  emissions in Nashville.
  
  Bowen is now working in the solar energy industry analyzing siting
  and performance for utility-scale solar energy deployments.

- [**Pam Hoover**](https://aquaeter.com/experts/pamela-a-hoover-p-e/) 
  Studied decision processes used by water treatment
  operators to manage taste and odor issues, and the impacts of climate 
  change on treatment. Her work has important implications for training 
  the next generation of water treatment operators.
  
  Pam is now Director of Corporate Health and Safety and 
  Technical Director for Environmental Permitting & Compliance,
  Environmental Assessments, and NEPA Screening at AquAeTer, an 
  environmental engineering company based in .
  
- [**Chris Tasich**](https://christasich.com/) 
  developed a model of sediment deposition in intertidal lands along
  tidal channels in coastal Bangladesh, and assessed the role of
  sediment transport and deposition for the long-term sustainability of
  the Bengal Delta.
  
  Chris is now a U.S. Presidential Management Fellow, working at the 
  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on models of the release and 
  fate of ozone-depleting substances in the atmosphere.
  He also worked at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
  applying data science to understanding and forecasting infectious 
  disease outbreaks.

- **David Knorr** 
  graduated with his M.S. in 2019.
  His graduate studies focused on investigating connections between 
  gentrification and access to public transit in Nashville. 
  David applied machine learning techniques to analyzing patterns of change 
  in home sales and prices, building permits, and demographic and economic 
  changes throughout Nashville and Davidson County. 
  David developed a new way to identify gentrification based on patterns in 
  data, rather than older approaches that defined gentrification based on 
  theoretical considerations that often did not fit the reality of what was
  happening in different cities.
  David's method also allowed him to develop a predictive model that can provide
  early warning of which census tracts are at greatest risk for disruptive
  gentrification.
  
  David is now a Staff Scientist at Newfields, a large environmental engineering
  firm in Atlanta, GA.
  
- [**Emily K. Burchfield**](https://www.emilyburchfield.org/)
  graduated with her Ph.D. in 2017.
  Her graduate studies focused on combining intensive computational methods of
  geospatial analysis with satellite remote-sensing imagery and on-the-ground
  research on farmers coping with water scarcity in Bangladesh. Emily made
  extensive use of Bayesian statistical methods to analyze her data and developed
  agent-based models of the economic and social impacts of farmers' decision 
  processes.
  
  Emily also obtained a grant from the National Socio-Environmental Synthesis
  Center to run a graduate pursuit project: This was a graduate-student only 
  research project for which Emily was principal investigator. She recruited an 
  interdisciplinary team of graduate students from universities across the 
  U.S. to work together assessing the economic and non-economic impact of 
  drought in every county in the contiguous United States.

  Emily is now an Assistant Professor at Emory University's Department of 
  Environmental Science.

- [**John J. Nay**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnjnay)
  graduated with his Ph.D. in 2017.
  His graduate studies focused on computational decision science, combining
  machine learning, behavioral economics, and field work in Sri Lanka and
  Bangladesh. John applied machine learning tools and agent-based modeling
  to a wide variety of problems, from identifying the strategies real people
  use in playing  games to analyzing law and policy.

  While he was still a graduate student, John founded a company,
  [Skopos Labs](https://election.skoposlabs.com/), which applies artificial
  intelligence to predicting developments in policy and financial markets, 
  with an emphasis on connections to climate change.

  After graduating, John divided his time between being CEO of Skopos Labs and
  two postdoctoral fellowships: in legal informatics at the New York University 
  Law School and in internet and society at Harvard University's Berkman Klein
  Center for Internet and Society.
  
  John's next ventures were co-founding Brooklyn Artificial Intelligence
  and Brooklyn Investment Group.
  
  John is now working full time as founder and CEO of [Norm.ai](https://norm.ai),
  which develops artificial intelligence agents to help companies 
  comply with government regulations. 

- [**Rachel Shoemaker Manning**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-shumaker-manning-93b67b99/) 
  graduated with her M.S. in 2017.
  Her graduate studies focused on statistical analysis of access to safe 
  drinking water in rural communities in Southwestern Bangladesh.
  
  Rachel is now an Environmental Scientist at Dewberry Engineers and co-owner
  of [Carolina Blooms](https://www.carolinablooms18.com/), a 
  family-owned flower business.
  

- **Laura Benneyworth** graduated with her Ph.D. in 2016.
  Her graduate studies focused on integrating detailed chemical analysis
  of water quality in Bangladesh with social-scientific research on people's
  perceptions of water quality and the sources of water they use.

  Laura discovered that rural households in Bangladesh often have
  great difficulty finding safe water to drink and often don't even
  realize how poor the quality of their water is. These difficulties
  are far greater than one would guess from the official figures on
  water availablity.

  After graduating, Laura worked as a GIS analyst for the Tennessee
  Department of Transportation and as a GIS consultant.
  She is now retired.

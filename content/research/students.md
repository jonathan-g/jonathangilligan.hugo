Students working with me are engaged in a variety of projects to combine 
knowledge about the physical environment and social, political, and economic 
conditions.
This can include analysis of remote-sensing imagery from satellites, working 
with GIS databases, developing agent-based models, and conducting 
spatiotemporal statistical analysis.

Students write and publish papers, often as first-author, in scientific journals
and present research results at national and international conferences.

## Current Students

- [**Kelsea Best**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelsea-best-5a93a5a2/) 
  is researching connections between environmental change,
  livelihoods, and population movement in Bangladesh. Kelsea applies machine
  learning to survey data to identify patterns in the characteristics of 
  people who relocate and will use those insights to develop agent-based models
  to simulate migration patterns.
  
  Kelsea is also Principal Investigator on a graduate pursuit project at the 
  National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center. 
  This project is a graduate-student only 
  research project for which Kelsea recruited an interdisciplinary team of 
  graduate students from universities across the U.S. to work together on 
  understanding connections between climate change and gentrification along
  the entire Atlantic Coast of the United States.

- **Bowen He** is studying ways to use data science to promote social justice 
  and effective policymaking on the environment. 
  His principal dissertation project is investigating the impact of the 2010 
  flood in Nashville and the subsequent home buyout program on social 
  vulnerability and the integrity of neighborhoods in Nashville. 
  He is also developing an interactive web-based application for comparing the
  potential impacts of different policies on greenhouse gas emissions in 
  Nashville, and he is developing indices of climate change for a proposed
  climate prediction market.

- **Pam Hoover** is studying the decision processes used by water treatment
  operators. She hopes to apply the results of this investigation to developing
  technology for training and and providing decision-support for the next
  generation of water treatment operators.
  
- [**Chris Tasich**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christasich/) 
  is studying governance of vulnerable landscapes in Bangladesh.
  Chris has developed a model of sediment deposition in intertidal 
  lands along the tidal channels in coastal Bangladesh. He is applying
  agent-based models of local decision-making to study how communities might 
  make use of different approaches to managing vulnerable lands in the face
  of sea-level rise and other environmental change.

## Recently Graduated Students

- **David Knorr** 
  graduated with his M.S. in 2019.
  His graduate studies focused on investigating connections between 
  gentrification and access to public transit in Nashville. 
  David applied machine learning techniques to analyzing patterns of change 
  in home sales and prices, building permits, and demographic and economic 
  changes throughout Nashville and Davidson County. 
  David developed a new way to identify gentrification based on patterns in 
  data, rather than older approaches that defined gentrification based on 
  theoretical considerations that often did not fit the reality of what was
  happening in different cities.
  David's method also allowed him to develop a predictive model that can provide
  early warning of which census tracts are at greatest risk for disruptive
  gentrification.
  
  David is now a Staff Scientist at Newfields, a large environmental engineering
  firm in Atlanta, GA.
  
- __[Emily K. Burchfield](https://www.emilyburchfield.org/)__ 
  graduated with her Ph.D. in 2017.
  Her graduate studies focused on combining intensive computational methods of
  geospatial analysis with satellite remote-sensing imagery and on-the-ground
  research on farmers coping with water scarcity in Bangladesh. Emily made
  extensive use of Bayesian statistical methods to analyze her data and developed
  agent-based models of the economic and social impacts of farmers' decision 
  processes.
  
  Emily also obtained a grant from the National Socio-Environmental Synthesis
  Center to run a graduate pursuit project: This was a graduate-student only 
  research project for which Emily was principal investigator. She recruited an 
  interdisciplinary team of graduate students from universities across the 
  U.S. to work together assessing the economic and non-economic impact of 
  drought in every county in the contiguous United States.

  Emily is now an Assistant Professor at Emory University's Department of 
  Environmental Science.

- __[John J. Nay](http://johnjnay.com)__ graduated with his Ph.D. in 2017.
  His graduate studies focused on computational decision science, combining
  machine learning, behavioral economics, and field work in Sri Lanka and
  Bangladesh. John applied machine learning tools and agent-based modeling
  to a wide variety of problems, from identifying the strategies real people
  use in playing  games to analyzing law and policy.

  While he was still a graduate student, John founded a company,
  [Skopos Labs](https://www.skoposlabs.com), which applies artificial
  intelligence to predicting developments in policy and financial markets, 
  with an emphasis on connections to climate change.

  After graduating, John divided his time between being CEO of Skopos Labs and
  two postdoctoral fellowships: in legal informatics at the New York University 
  Law School and in internet and society at Harvard University's Berkman Klein
  Center for Internet and Society.
  
  John is now working full time as CEO of Skopos Labs. 

- [__Rachel Shoemaker Manning__](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-shumaker-manning-93b67b99/) 
  graduated with her M.S. in 2017.
  Her graduate studies focused on statistical analysis of access to safe 
  drinking water in rural communities in Southwestern Bangladesh.
  
  Rachel is now an Environmental Scientist at Dewberry Engineers and co-owner
  of [Carolina Blooms](https://www.carolinablooms18.com/), a 
  family-owned flower business.
  

- __Laura Benneyworth__ graduated with her Ph.D. in 2016.
  Her graduate studies focused on integrating detailed chemical analysis
  of water quality in Bangladesh with social-scientific research on people's
  perceptions of water quality and the sources of water they use.

  Laura discovered that rural households in Bangladesh often have
  great difficulty finding safe water to drink and often don't even
  realize how poor the quality of their water is. These difficulties
  are far greater than one would guess from the official figures on
  water availablity.

  After graduating, Laura has worked as a GIS analyst for the Tennessee
  Department of Transportation and as a GIS consultant.

# Overview

I work primarily at the intersection of natural science, social science, and 
public policy with a focus on coupled human-natural systems and on the ways in 
which scientific knowledge and uncertainty affect policy decisions about the 
environment.

My current work makes extensive use of agent-based models to simulate the ways 
that small changes in behavior at the individual level can add up to large-scale 
shifts at the level of the whole population, giving what is often referred to as 
"emergent phenomena." These models have the potential to help us identify 
vulnerabilities to environmental stress and opportunities to promote sustainable 
adaptations.

My past research has included nonlinear dynamics and chaos, quantum optics, 
stratospheric photochemistry, electrocardiology, physical mechanisms of laser 
surgery, laser processing and analysis of semiconductors, laser-cooling of 
atomic ions, and high-precision atomic and molecular spectroscopy.

# The Big Picture

All of my research interests relate to the question of how to society can manage 
environmental hazards within the context of democratic governance and 
significant scientific uncertainty.

For most important anthropogenic (human-caused) environmental hazards there is 
significant scientific uncertainty about the nature and severity of the 
consequences and this uncertainty makes many of the standard approaches to risk 
management ineffective. For instance, while it is unambiguous that human 
production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is changing earthb

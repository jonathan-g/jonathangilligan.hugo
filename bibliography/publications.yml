  abstract: The decision to migrate is complex and is often influenced by a combination
    of economic, social, political, and environmental pressures. Household survey
    instruments can capture detailed information about migration histories and their
    contexts, but it can be challenging to identify important predictors from large
    numbers of covariates with standard statistical methods, such as regression analyses.
    Machine learning techniques are well suited to pattern identification and can
    identify important covariates from large datasets. We report on the application
    of machine learning approaches to two large surveys collected from a total of
    more than 2800 households in southwestern Bangladesh. We applied random forest
    classification and regression models to identify significant covariates with the
    greatest predictive power for household migration decisions. The results show
    that random forest models are able to identify nuances in predictors of different
    types of migration and migration in different communities. Random forests also
    outperform logistic regression and support vector machines in predicting migration
    in all cases analyzed. Therefore, random forest models and other machine learning
    methods can be useful for improving the predictive accuracy of migration models
    and identifying patterns in complex social datasets. Future work should continue
    to explore the potential of machine learning techniques applied to questions of
    environmental migration.

  title: Random forest analysis of two household surveys can identify important predictors

  abstract: Climate change interacts with social, economic, and political forces in
    ways that can shape demographic behavior. Yet, the link between environmental
    stress and marriage has received limited attention. Using survey data from 615
    Bangladeshi households, we examine the relationship between extreme weather in
    the form of heat waves and dry spells, and the risk of marriage over the period
    from 1989 to 2013. We find that girls and women are at an increased risk of marrying
    in the year of or following heat waves. The link is strongest for women aged 18
    to 23, and weakest for those 11 to 14. We also explore the hypothesis that extreme
    weather leads families to accept less desirable marriage proposals for daughters.
    We find that those who wed during periods of extreme heat married into poorer
    households and to husbands with less education. Similarly, those who married during
    abnormally dry periods married men man with less education and who were more supportive
    of intimate partner violence. Together these results suggest that, when Bangladeshi
    families face environmental shocks, they cope by hastening the marriage of daughters
    or accepting less desirable marriage proposals. Such practices are likely to have
    long-term impacts on the health and well-being of women and children, and underscore
    the unique vulnerabilities faced by women as climate change intensifies.

  abstract: 'Modeling is essential to characterize and explore complex societal and
    environmental issues in systematic and collaborative ways. Socio-environmental
    systems (SES) modeling integrates knowledge and perspectives into conceptual and
    computational tools that explicitly recognize how human decisions affect the environment.
    Depending on the modeling purpose, many SES modelers also realize that involvement
    of stakeholders and experts is fundamental to support social learning and decision-making
    processes for achieving improved environmental and social outcomes. The contribution
    of this paper lies in identifying and formulating grand challenges that need to
    be overcome to accelerate the development and adaptation of SES modeling. Eight
    challenges are delineated: bridging epistemologies across disciplines; multi-dimensional
    uncertainty assessment and management; scales and scaling issues; combining qualitative
    and quantitative methods and data; furthering the adoption and impacts of SES
    modeling on policy; capturing structural changes; representing human dimensions
    in SES; and leveraging new data types and sources. These challenges limit our
    ability to effectively use SES modeling to provide the knowledge and information
    essential for supporting decision making. Whereas some of these challenges are
    not unique to SES modeling and may be pervasive in other scientific fields, they
    still act as barriers as well as research opportunities for the SES modeling community.
    For each challenge, we outline basic steps that can be taken to surmount the underpinning
    barriers. Thus, the paper identifies priority research areas in SES modeling,
    chiefly related to progressing modeling products, processes and practices.'

  abstract: The growing sense of urgency by the public for action to address climate
    change stands in stark contrast to the slow pace and limited accomplishments of
    national and international institutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Political
    institutions face significant structural barriers to taking strong and rapid action
    to cut emissions, but private environmental governance has potential to avoid
    those barriers and achieve rapid emissions reductions. It appears unlikely that
    private governance alone can reduce emissions enough to stabilize the climate,
    but it does have the potential to reduce emissions sufficiently and quickly enough
    to buy time for enacting more comprehensive public governance measures. In this
    Perspective, we review what is known about private governance, present a framework
    for analyzing private governance initiatives, outline the prospects of the framework
    for understanding and guiding private governance, and identify future research
    priorities for applying this framework.

  abstract: This Essay provides a simple heuristic to enable public and private policymakers
    to focus on the most important climate mitigation options. Policymakers face a
    blizzard of information, advocacy, and policy options, and it is easy to lose
    sight of the forest for the trees. Many options are attractive on the surface
    but will not meaningfully address the problem or are unlikely to be adopted in
    the foreseeable future. If policymakers make the right decision when confronting
    three essential choices or forks in the road, though, the result will be 60% to
    70% reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, an amount that will keep widely-adopted
    climate mitigation goals in reach. The three options are decarbonization of the
    electrical grid, electrification of the motor vehicle fleet, and electrification
    of buildings. International, national, and subnational officials, philanthropists,
    corporate executives, advocacy group leaders, and households have the ability
    to prioritize these three options in their regulatory, purchasing, and other actions.
    If they make the right choice on these three options, many other mistakes can
    be made without jeopardizing the chance to achieve widely-adopted emissions targets.
    If they make the wrong choice, few combinations of other viable options can achieve
    the needed reductions. In the face of a growing consensus that major, prompt emissions
    reductions are required, the forks in the road approach can provide policymakers
    with the mental framework necessary to make smart decisions and ignore the noise
    surrounding climate law and policy

  abstract: "This Article demonstrates that a new revolving door is emerging between\
    \ environmental-advocacy groups and the private sector. Since the birth of the\
    \ modern regulatory state, scholars have raised concerns that the revolving door\
    \ between corporations and government agencies could induce government officials\
    \ to pursue corporate interests rather than the public interest. The legal and\
    \ political-science literatures have identified several benefits that may arise\
    \ from the revolving door, but the thrust of the scholarship to date has emphasized\
    \ the potential harms. Using several data sources, we demonstrate that as the\
    \ private sector has begun to play an increasing role in environmental governance\
    \ in recent years, a new revolving door has emerged between environmental-advocacy\
    \ groups and corporations, institutional investment firms, and private equity\
    \ firms. We demonstrate that this new revolving door is surprisingly common, and\
    \ we examine the implications for the future of public and private environmental\
    \ governance. Although this new revolving door creates new risks, we argue that\
    \ it may turn on its head the central concern about the revolving door: The movement\
    \ of environmental advocates into corporate management positions may play the\
    \ role of greening corporate behavior and may accelerate the development of private\
    \ environmental initiatives. We focus on the movement of employees in the environmental\
    \ area\u2014a new green revolving door\u2014but we suggest that this new revolving\
    \ door also may be emerging in labor, health and safety, and other regulatory\
    \ areas."

  abstract: 'Hazards and disasters arise from interactions between environmental and
    social processes so interdisciplinary research is crucial to understanding and
    effectively managing them. Despite support and encouragement from funding agencies,
    universities, and journals and growing interest from researchers, interdisciplinary
    disaster research teams face significant obstacles, such as the difficulty of
    establishing effective communication and understanding across disciplines. Better
    understanding of interdisciplinary teamwork can also have important practical
    benefits for operational disaster planning and response.Social studies of science
    distinguishes different kinds of expertise and different modes of communication.
    Understanding these differences can help interdisciplinary research teams communicate
    more clearly and work together more effectively. The primary role of a researcher
    is in *contributory expertise*contributory expertise (the ability to make original
    contributions to a discipline); but *interactional expertise*interactional expertise
    in other disciplines (the ability to understand their literature and communicate
    with their practitioners) can play an important role in interdisciplinary collaborations.
    Developing interactional expertise requires considerable time and effort, which
    can be challenging for a busy researcher, and also requires a foundation of trust
    and communication among team members. Three distinct aspects of communication
    play important roles in effective interdisciplinary communication: *dialects*dialects,
    *metaphors*metaphors, and *articulation*articulation.There are different ways
    to develop interactional expertise and effective communication, so researchers
    can pursue approaches that suit their circumstances. It will be important for
    future research on interdisciplinary disaster research to identify best practices
    for building trust, facilitating communication, and developing interactional expertise.'

  abstract: "Employee energy benefits (EEBs), such as subsidies for employee home\
    \ energy audits and financial incentives for carpooling to work, aim to influence\
    \ employees\u2019 environmental behaviors outside of work. Exploring these understudied\
    \ benefits would offer new insights that can enrich theories of employer and employee\
    \ motivations for engaging in environmental behavior, as well as reveal new strategies\
    \ for making significant progress on environment goals. By drawing upon employer\
    \ reports and conducting a survey of 482 US adults employed full-time, we found\
    \ that there are a wide range of types of EEBs currently offered by employers,\
    \ and furthermore, they were more likely to be offered in certain industries,\
    \ such as state and local governments but not others such as retail. These benefits\
    \ were offered to 17% of employees and included a vast array of strategies and\
    \ approaches. Guided by theorizing on employer and employee motivation, open-ended\
    \ responses suggested employers were perceived to offer EEBs to maximize competiveness\
    \ and because of social responsibility concerns, and employees tended to enroll\
    \ because they wanted to save money and time or because they cared about the environment.\
    \ Finally, EEBs were linked to employee environmental behavior and morale. The\
    \ findings reveal new information about the types of EEBs being offered, motivations\
    \ for offering and enrolling in EEBs, and their relationship to employee behavior\
    \ and morale. This work suggests numerous lines of promising new research."

  abstract: 'Drought threatens food and water security around the world, and this
    threat is likely to become more severe under climate change. High-resolution predictive
    information can help farmers, water managers, and others to manage the effects
    of drought. We have created an open-source tool to produce short-term forecasts
    of vegetation health at high spatial resolution, using data that are global in
    coverage. The tool automates downloading and processing Moderate Resolution Imaging
    Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data sets and training gradient-boosted machine models
    on hundreds of millions of observations to predict future values of the enhanced
    vegetation index. We compared the predictive power of different sets of variables
    (MODIS surface reflectance data and Level-3 MODIS products) in two regions with
    distinct agro-ecological systems, climates, and cloud coverage: Sri Lanka and
    California. Performance in California is higher because of more cloud-free days
    and less missing data. In both regions, the correlation between the actual and
    model predicted vegetation health values in agricultural areas is above 0.75.
    Predictive power more than doubles in agricultural areas compared to a baseline
    model.'

  abstract: Private sector action provides one of the most promising opportunities
    to reduce the risks of climate change, buying time while governments move slowly
    or even oppose climate mitigation. Starting with the insight that much of the
    resistance to climate mitigation is grounded in concern about the role of government,
    this books draws on law, policy, social science, and climate science to demonstrate
    how private initiatives are already bypassing government inaction in the US and
    around the globe. It makes a persuasive case that private governance can reduce
    global carbon emissions by a billion tons per year over the next decade. Combining
    an examination of the growth of private climate initiatives over the last decade,
    a theory of why private actors are motivated to reduce emissions, and a review
    of viable next steps, this book speaks to scholars, business and advocacy group
    managers, philanthropists, policymakers, and anyone interested in climate change.

  abstract: "Since the 1960s, $\\sim 5000~\\text{km}^2$ of tidal deltaplain in southwest\
    \ Bangladesh has been embanked and converted to densely inhabited, agricultural\
    \ islands (i.e., polders). This landscape is juxtaposed to the adjacent Sundarbans,\
    \ a pristine mangrove forest, both well connected by a dense network of tidal\
    \ channels that effectively convey water and sediment throughout the region. The\
    \ extensive embanking in poldered areas, however, has greatly reduced the tidal\
    \ prism (i.e., volume of water) transported through local channels. We reveal\
    \ that $>600~\\text{km}$ of these major waterways have infilled in recent decades,\
    \ converting to land through enhanced sedimentation and the direct blocking of\
    \ waterways by embankments and sluice gates. Nearly all of the observed closures\
    \ ($\\sim 98\\%$) have occurred along the embanked polder systems, with no comparable\
    \ changes occurring in channels of the Sundarbans ($<2\\%$ change). We attribute\
    \ most of the channel infilling to the local reduction of tidal prism in poldered\
    \ areas and the associated decline in current velocities. The infilled channels\
    \ account for $\\sim 90~\\text{km}^2$ of new land in the last 40\u201350 years,\
    \ the rate of which, $\\sim 2~\\text{km}^2/\\text{yr}$, offsets the $4~\\text{km}^2/\\\
    text{yr}$ that is eroded at the coast, and is equivalent to $\\sim 20\\%$ of the\
    \ new land produced naturally at the Ganges-Brahmaputra tidal rivermouth. Most\
    \ of this new land, called \u2018khas\u2019 in Bengali, has been reclaimed for\
    \ agriculture or aquaculture, contributing to the local economy. However, benefits\
    \ are tempered by the loss of navigable waterways for commerce, transportation,\
    \ and fishing, as well as the forced rerouting of tidal waters and sediments necessary\
    \ to sustain this low-lying landscape against rising sea level. A more sustainable\
    \ delta will require detailed knowledge of the consequences of these hydrodynamic\
    \ changes to support more scientifically-grounded management of water, sediment,\
    \ and tidal energy distribution."

    \ variability, or temporal differences. This paper reports on the findings of\
    \ an interdisciplinary investigation of drinking water insecurity in a rural coastal\
    \ south-western Bangladesh. Drinking water quality is assessed by comparison of\
    \ locally measured concentrations to national levels and water quality criteria;\
    \ resident\u2019s access to potable water and their perceptions are based on local\
    \ social surveys. Residents in the study area use groundwater far less than the\
    \ national average; salinity and local rainwater scarcity necessitates the use\
    \ of multiple water sources throughout the year. Groundwater concentrations of\
    \ arsenic and specific conductivity (SpC) were greater than surface water (pond)\
    \ concentrations; there was no statistically significant seasonal difference in\
    \ mean concentrations in groundwater, but there was for ponds, with arsenic higher\
    \ in the dry season. Average arsenic concentrations in local water drinking were\
    \ 2\u20134 times times the national average. All of the local groundwater samples\

  abstract: 'Drought and water scarcity are growing challenges to agriculture around
    the world. Farmers can adapt through both individual and community-based collective
    actions. We draw on extensive field-work conducted with paddy farmers in rural
    Sri Lanka to study adaptations to water scarcity, including switching to less
    water-intensive crops, farming collectively on shared land, and individually turning
    to groundwater by digging wells. We explore how variability in climate affects
    agricultural decision-making at the community and individual levels using three
    types of decision-making, each characterized by an objective function: risk-averse
    expected utility, regret-adjusted expected utility, and prospect theory loss-aversion.
    We also assess how the introduction of individualized access to irrigation water
    with wells affects community-based drought mitigation practices. Preliminary results
    suggest that the growth of well-irrigation may produce sudden disruptions to community-based
    adaptations, but that this depends on the mental models farmers use to think about
    risk and make decisions under uncertainty.'

  abstract: Droughts affect more people than any other natural disaster. Drought severity
    is not merely a function of precipitation; it emerges from a web of interrelations
    between human and natural systems. The impacts of drought are equally complex,
    shifting across temporal scales, economic sectors, and regions. Even in regions
    with similar hydroclimatic characteristics, there is tremendous variation in the
    effects of drought. This study combines satellite imagery, geospatial data, and
    qualitative data to identify the multi-scalar factors that drive variations in
    agricultural responses to drought. We analyzed eleven years of remotely sensed
    imagery to identify agricultural areas in which cultivation occurred during an
    extreme drought in Sri Lanka. We visited a subset of these communities and conducted
    interviews with officials and farmers to identify the factors that influenced
    agricultural adaptation. Results suggest that though structural factors such as
    infrastructural capacity and physical environment significantly affect agricultural
    adaptation, dynamic factors such as local control of water supply, perceived risk,
    community cohesion, and farmer experience explain significant variation in the
    adaptive capacity of agricultural systems.

  abstract: "A spatiotemporal analysis of two well-known agricultural drought indices,\

    \ Index at a 9-month scale (SPI-9), is presented for Sri Lanka. The analysis was\
    \ conducted based on monthly precipitation and temperature data from January 1881\
    \ to December 2010 using 13 stations distributed across the three climatic zones\
    \ of the country. Principal component analysis shows that the first two principal\
    \ components of PDSI and SPI-9 are spatially comparable and could physically represent\
    \ the two main monsoons. A wavelet analysis of these principal components\u2019\
    \ scores for both indices indicates a stronger association between the Northeastern\
    \ monsoon and El-Ni\xF1o in recent decades. Correlation analysis with agricultural\
    \ metrics suggests that different indices might be appropriate for each of the\
    \ climatic zones in Sri Lanka. PDSI correlated best with the intermediate zone\
    \ districts; SPI-9 correlated best with the dry zone districts; but neither index\
    \ correlated well with the wet zone districts."

  type: paper-conference

  ISSN: 1944-7973
  abstract: Cities across the world have had to diversify and expand their water supply
    systems in response to demand growth, groundwater depletion and pollution, and
    instability and inadequacy of regional surface freshwater sources. In the U.S.,
    these problems plague not only the arid Western cities but increasingly also cities
    in the Eastern portions of the country. Although cities continue to seek out new
    sources of water via Promethean projects of long-distance supply systems, desalinization
    plants, and the recharge of aquifers with surface water, they also pursue water
    conservation because of its low cost and other benefits. We examine water conservation
    as a complex sociotechnical system comprising interactions of political, sociodemographic,
    economic, and hydroclimatological factors. We provide quantitative data on the
    factors that affect more and less advanced transitions in water conservation regimes,
    and we show that water stress and other hydrological data can only partially predict
    the transition. We also provide qualitative case studies to identify institutional
    and political barriers to more advanced water conservation regimes. This interdisciplinary,
    mixed methods approach typifies the need for knowledge that informs hydrologists
    about how their research may or may not be adopted by decision-makers.

  abstract: "Light scattering is used to monitor the dynamics and energy thresholds\
    \ of laser-induced structural alterations in biopolymers due to irradiation by\
    \ a free electron laser\_(FEL) in the infrared\_(IR) wavelength range 2.2\_to\
    \ 8.5\_$\\mu$m. Attenuated total reflectance (ATR) Fourier-transform\_IR\_(FTIR)\
    \ spectroscopy is used to examine infrared tissue absorption spectra before and\
    \ after irradiation. Light scattering by bovine and porcine cartilage and cornea\
    \ samples is measured in real time during FEL irradiation using a 650-nm diode\
    \ laser and a diode photoarray with time resolution of 10\_ms. The data on the\
    \ time dependence of light scattering in the tissue are modeled to estimate the\
    \ approximate values of kinetic parameters for denaturation as functions of laser\
    \ wavelength and radiant exposure. We found that the denaturation threshold is\
    \ slightly lower for cornea than for cartilage, and both depend on laser wavelength.\
    \ An inverse correlation between denaturation thresholds and the absorption spectrum\
    \ of the tissue is observed for many wavelengths; however, for wavelengths near\
    \ 3\_and 6\_$\\mu$m, the denaturation threshold does not exhibit the inverse correlation,\
    \ instead being governed by heating kinetics of tissue. It is shown that light\

  abstract: "Hydrogen chemistry in thin films and biological systems is one of the\
    \ most difficult experimental problems in today\u2019s science and technology.\
    \ We successfully tested a novel solution, based on the spectroscopic version\
    \ of scanning near-field optical microscopy\_(SNOM). The tunable infrared radiation\
    \ of the Vanderbilt free-electron laser enabled us to reveal clearly hydrogen-decorated\
    \ grain boundaries on nominally hydrogen-free diamond films. The images were obtained\
    \ by SNOM detection of reflected 3.5\_micron photons, corresponding to the C-H\
    \ stretch absorption, and reached a lateral resolution of 0.2\_micron, well below\
    \ the $\\lambda/2$ ($\\lambda$ = wavelength) limit of classical microscopy."

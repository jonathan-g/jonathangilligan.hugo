  title: Random forest analysis of two household surveys can identify important predictors
    of migration in Bangladesh
  container-title: Journal of Computational Social Science

  volume: '14'

  abstract: The decision to migrate is complex and is often influenced by a combination
    of economic, social, political, and environmental pressures. Household survey
    instruments can capture detailed information about migration histories and their
    contexts, but it can be challenging to identify important predictors from large
    numbers of covariates with standard statistical methods, such as regression analyses.
    Machine learning techniques are well suited to pattern identification and can
    identify important covariates from large datasets. We report on the application
    of machine learning approaches to two large surveys collected from a total of
    more than 2800 households in southwestern Bangladesh. We applied random forest
    classification and regression models to identify significant covariates with the
    greatest predictive power for household migration decisions. The results show
    that random forest models are able to identify nuances in predictors of different
    types of migration and migration in different communities. Random forests also
    outperform logistic regression and support vector machines in predicting migration
    in all cases analyzed. Therefore, random forest models and other machine learning
    methods can be useful for improving the predictive accuracy of migration models
    and identifying patterns in complex social datasets. Future work should continue
    to explore the potential of machine learning techniques applied to questions of
    environmental migration.

  title: 'Modeling multi-level patterns of environmental migration in bangladesh:
    An agent-based approach'
  title-short: Modeling multi-level patterns of environmental migration in bangladesh
  container-title: Proceedings of the 2021 winter simulation conference
  publisher: IEEE Press
  publisher-place: Piscataway, NJ, USA
  status: published
  abstract: Environmental change interacts with population migration in complex ways
    that depend on interactions between impacts on individual households and on communities.
    These coupled individual-collective dynamics make agent-based simulations useful
    for studying environmental migration. We present an original agent-based model
    that simulates environment-migration dynamics in terms of the impacts of natural
    hazards on labor markets in rural communities, with households deciding whether
    to migrate based on maximizing their expected income. We use a pattern-oriented
    approach that seeks to reproduce observed patterns of environmentally-driven migration
    in Bangladesh. The model is parameterized with empirical data and unknown parameters
    are calibrated to reproduce the observed patterns. This model can reproduce these
    patterns, but only for a narrow range of parameters. Future work will compare
    income-maximizing decisions to psychologically complex decision heuristics that
    include non-economic considerations.

    An agent-based modeling approach for Cape Town, South Africa'
  title-short: Assessing food-energy-water resources management strategies at city
    scale
  container-title: Resources, Conservation and Recycling
  page: '105573'
  volume: '170'
  status: published
  abstract: The impact of human activities and climate change occurs across a range
    of spatial and temporal scales, and the city or regional scale is critical for
    managing food-energy-water (FEW) resources. We develop a coupled human-natural
    system model for Cape Town, South Africa, which consists of an agent-based model
    and a regional hydrologic model, to study the FEW nexus connecting the agricultural,
    urban, and hydroelectric generation sectors. We use the model to compare three
    policies—a simple adaptive approach, adaptation with free water to indigent households,
    and water supply augmentation—and assess their ability to provide reliable FEW
    services to the different stakeholders under four different climate scenarios,
    representing moderate to severe amounts of warming. Our results indicate that
    Cape Town is likely to face increasing water stress as temperatures rise, and
    that adaptation strategies could effectively mitigate the effects of water limitations
    and avoid severe failures in providing FEW services across sectors. One way to
    manage demand for FEW services is by adjusting water price tariffs, but high prices
    create inequality in access to water for households with different incomes. Our
    analysis suggests that the water supply system in Cape Town may already be at,
    if not over, its sustainable capacity within the FEW nexus. Our model serves as
    a test-bed for assessing policies to manage stresses on water resources for the
    benefit of stakeholders across FEW sectors. This model can be adapted to cities
    and regions around the globe.

  volume: '41'
  status: published
  abstract: 'Hazards and disasters arise from interactions between environmental and
    social processes so interdisciplinary research is crucial to understanding and
    effectively managing them. Despite support and encouragement from funding agencies,
    universities, and journals and growing interest from researchers, interdisciplinary
    disaster research teams face significant obstacles, such as the difficulty of
    establishing effective communication and understanding across disciplines. Better
    understanding of interdisciplinary teamwork can also have important practical
    benefits for operational disaster planning and response.Social studies of science
    distinguishes different kinds of expertise and different modes of communication.
    Understanding these differences can help interdisciplinary research teams communicate
    more clearly and work together more effectively. The primary role of a researcher
    is in *contributory expertise*contributory expertise (the ability to make original
    contributions to a discipline); but *interactional expertise*interactional expertise
    in other disciplines (the ability to understand their literature and communicate
    with their practitioners) can play an important role in interdisciplinary collaborations.
    Developing interactional expertise requires considerable time and effort, which
    can be challenging for a busy researcher, and also requires a foundation of trust
    and communication among team members. Three distinct aspects of communication
    play important roles in effective interdisciplinary communication: *dialects*dialects,
    *metaphors*metaphors, and *articulation*articulation.There are different ways
    to develop interactional expertise and effective communication, so researchers
    can pursue approaches that suit their circumstances. It will be important for
    future research on interdisciplinary disaster research to identify best practices
    for building trust, facilitating communication, and developing interactional expertise.'

  title: Predicting public transportation load to estimate the probability of social
    distancing violations
  container-title: Proceedings of the workshop on ai for urban mobility at the 35th
    aaai conference on artificial intelligence
  status: in press
  abstract: Public transit agencies struggle to maintain transit accessibility with
    reduced resources, unreliable ridership data, reduced vehicle capacities due to
    social distancing, and reduced services due to driver unavailability. In collaboration
    with transit agencies from two large metropolitan areas in the USA, we are designing
    novel approaches for addressing the afore-mentioned challenges by collecting accurate
    real-time ridership data, providing guidance to commuters, and performing operational
    optimization for public transit. We estimate rider-ship data using historical
    automated passenger counting data, conditional on a set of relevant determinants.
    Accurate ridership forecasting is essential to optimize the public transit schedule,
    which is necessary to improve current fixed lines with on-demand transit. Also,
    passenger crowding has been a problem for public transportation since it deteriorates
    passengers’ wellbeing and satisfaction. During the COVID-19 pandemic, passenger
    crowding has gained importance since it represents a risk for social distancing
    violations. Therefore, we are creating optimization models to ensure that social
    distancing norms can be adequately followed while ensuring that the total demand
    for transit is met. We will then use accurate forecasts for operational optimization
    that includes (a) proactive fixed-line schedule optimization based on predicted
    demand, (b) dispatch of on-demand micro-transit, prioritizing at-risk populations,
    and (c) allocation of vehicles to transit and cargo trips, considering exigent
    vehicle maintenance requirements (i.e., disinfection). Finally, this paper presents
    some initial results from our project regarding the estimation of ridership in
    public transit.

  title-short: A scenario of solar geoengineering governance
  container-title: Futures
  page: '102809'
  volume: '132'
  status: published
  abstract: The paper examines a scenario exercise concerning deployment of solar
    geoengineering by a small group of states that are particularly vulnerable to
    climate change. Two groups of participants were each asked to provide expert decision-making
    advice to an alliance comprising great powers, and to propose a political response
    to the deployment initiative. This paper discusses the initial governance proposals
    and examines differences and exchanges between the groups throughout the exercise.
    The two groups delivered distinct governance proposals. The differences, which
    were driven largely by divergent worldviews and assumptions about the geopolitical
    context, provide insights into the complexities of responses to the “free-driver”
    of solar geoengineering deployment, internal functioning and cohesion of coalitions,
    and interactions among multiple responses to climate change.

  title: Extreme weather and marriage among girls and women in Bangladesh
  container-title: Global Environmental Change
  page: '102160'
  volume: '65'
  status: published
  abstract: Climate change interacts with social, economic, and political forces in
    ways that can shape demographic behavior. Yet, the link between environmental
    stress and marriage has received limited attention. Using survey data from 615
    Bangladeshi households, we examine the relationship between extreme weather in
    the form of heat waves and dry spells, and the risk of marriage over the period
    from 1989 to 2013. We find that girls and women are at an increased risk of marrying
    in the year of or following heat waves. The link is strongest for women aged 18
    to 23, and weakest for those 11 to 14. We also explore the hypothesis that extreme
    weather leads families to accept less desirable marriage proposals for daughters.
    We find that those who wed during periods of extreme heat married into poorer
    households and to husbands with less education. Similarly, those who married during
    abnormally dry periods married men man with less education and who were more supportive
    of intimate partner violence. Together these results suggest that, when Bangladeshi
    families face environmental shocks, they cope by hastening the marriage of daughters
    or accepting less desirable marriage proposals. Such practices are likely to have
    long-term impacts on the health and well-being of women and children, and underscore
    the unique vulnerabilities faced by women as climate change intensifies.

  title: Eight grand challenges in socio-environmental systems modeling
  container-title: Socio-Environmental Systems Modeling
  page: '16226'
  volume: '2'
  status: published
  abstract: 'Modeling is essential to characterize and explore complex societal and
    environmental issues in systematic and collaborative ways. Socio-environmental
    systems (SES) modeling integrates knowledge and perspectives into conceptual and
    computational tools that explicitly recognize how human decisions affect the environment.
    Depending on the modeling purpose, many SES modelers also realize that involvement
    of stakeholders and experts is fundamental to support social learning and decision-making
    processes for achieving improved environmental and social outcomes. The contribution
    of this paper lies in identifying and formulating grand challenges that need to
    be overcome to accelerate the development and adaptation of SES modeling. Eight
    challenges are delineated: bridging epistemologies across disciplines; multi-dimensional
    uncertainty assessment and management; scales and scaling issues; combining qualitative
    and quantitative methods and data; furthering the adoption and impacts of SES
    modeling on policy; capturing structural changes; representing human dimensions
    in SES; and leveraging new data types and sources. These challenges limit our
    ability to effectively use SES modeling to provide the knowledge and information
    essential for supporting decision making. Whereas some of these challenges are
    not unique to SES modeling and may be pervasive in other scientific fields, they
    still act as barriers as well as research opportunities for the SES modeling community.
    For each challenge, we outline basic steps that can be taken to surmount the underpinning
    barriers. Thus, the paper identifies priority research areas in SES modeling,
    chiefly related to progressing modeling products, processes and practices.'

  container-title-short: Energy Research & Social Science
  page: '101400'
  volume: '60'
  status: published
  abstract: The growing sense of urgency by the public for action to address climate
    change stands in stark contrast to the slow pace and limited accomplishments of
    national and international institutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Political
    institutions face significant structural barriers to taking strong and rapid action
    to cut emissions, but private environmental governance has potential to avoid
    those barriers and achieve rapid emissions reductions. It appears unlikely that
    private governance alone can reduce emissions enough to stabilize the climate,
    but it does have the potential to reduce emissions sufficiently and quickly enough
    to buy time for enacting more comprehensive public governance measures. In this
    Perspective, we review what is known about private governance, present a framework
    for analyzing private governance initiatives, outline the prospects of the framework
    for understanding and guiding private governance, and identify future research
    priorities for applying this framework.

  status: published
  abstract: This Article examines the argument that climate change is a “super wicked”
    problem. It concludes that the wicked problem concept is best viewed as a rhetorical
    device that served a valuable function in arguing against technocratic hubris
    in the early 1970s but is unhelpful and possibly counterproductive as a tool for
    modern climate policy analysis. Richard Lazarus improved on this analysis by emphasizing
    the urgency of a climate response in his characterization of the climate problem
    as “super wicked.” We suggest another approach based on Charles Lindblom’s “science
    of muddling through.” The muddling through approach supports the rhetorical points
    for which the original wicked problem concept was introduced and provides greater
    practical guidance for developing new laws and policies to address climate change
    and other complex and messy environmental problems.

    addresses technological and economic aspects of feasibility, but overlooks the
    behavioral, cultural, and social factors that affect theoretical and practical
    mitigation pathways. We present a tripartite framework that “unpacks” the concept
    of mitigation pathways by distinguishing three factors that together determine
    actual mitigation: technical potential, initiative feasibility, and behavioral
    plasticity. The framework aims to integrate and streamline heterogeneous disciplinary
    research traditions toward a more comprehensive and transparent approach that
    will facilitate learning across disciplines and enable mitigation pathways to
    more fully reflect available knowledge. We offer three suggestions for integrating
    the tripartite framework into current research on climate change mitigation.'

  page: 163-173
  volume: '31'
  status: published
  abstract: This Essay provides a simple heuristic to enable public and private policymakers
    to focus on the most important climate mitigation options. Policymakers face a
    blizzard of information, advocacy, and policy options, and it is easy to lose
    sight of the forest for the trees. Many options are attractive on the surface
    but will not meaningfully address the problem or are unlikely to be adopted in
    the foreseeable future. If policymakers make the right decision when confronting
    three essential choices or forks in the road, though, the result will be 60% to
    70% reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, an amount that will keep widely-adopted
    climate mitigation goals in reach. The three options are decarbonization of the
    electrical grid, electrification of the motor vehicle fleet, and electrification
    of buildings. International, national, and subnational officials, philanthropists,
    corporate executives, advocacy group leaders, and households have the ability
    to prioritize these three options in their regulatory, purchasing, and other actions.
    If they make the right choice on these three options, many other mistakes can
    be made without jeopardizing the chance to achieve widely-adopted emissions targets.
    If they make the wrong choice, few combinations of other viable options can achieve
    the needed reductions. In the face of a growing consensus that major, prompt emissions
    reductions are required, the forks in the road approach can provide policymakers
    with the mental framework necessary to make smart decisions and ignore the noise
    surrounding climate law and policy

  title: The new revolving door
  container-title: Case Western Reserve Law Review
  page: 1121-1149
  volume: '70'
  status: published
  abstract: 'This Article demonstrates that a new revolving door is emerging between
    environmental-advocacy groups and the private sector. Since the birth of the modern
    regulatory state, scholars have raised concerns that the revolving door between
    corporations and government agencies could induce government officials to pursue
    corporate interests rather than the public interest. The legal and political-science
    literatures have identified several benefits that may arise from the revolving
    door, but the thrust of the scholarship to date has emphasized the potential harms.
    Using several data sources, we demonstrate that as the private sector has begun
    to play an increasing role in environmental governance in recent years, a new
    revolving door has emerged between environmental-advocacy groups and corporations,
    institutional investment firms, and private equity firms. We demonstrate that
    this new revolving door is surprisingly common, and we examine the implications
    for the future of public and private environmental governance. Although this new
    revolving door creates new risks, we argue that it may turn on its head the central
    concern about the revolving door: The movement of environmental advocates into
    corporate management positions may play the role of greening corporate behavior
    and may accelerate the development of private environmental initiatives. We focus
    on the movement of employees in the environmental area—a new green revolving door—but
    we suggest that this new revolving door also may be emerging in labor, health
    and safety, and other regulatory areas.'

  abstract: 'Deep connections between water resources and food and energy production—the
    food-energy-water (FEW) nexus—complicate the challenge of sustainably managing
    an uncertain water supply. We present an agent-based model as a computational
    testbed for studying different approaches to managing the FEW nexus and apply
    the model to the 2017–2018 water crisis in Cape Town South Africa. We treat the
    FEW nexus connecting municipal water use by Cape Town residents, agricultural
    water use by vineyards, and hydroelectric generation. We compare two scenarios
    for responding to drought: business-as-usual (BAU), and holistic adaptive management
    (HAM), where BAU takes no action until the monthly supply is insufficient to meet
    demand, whereas HAM takes action by raising water tariffs when the reservoir storage
    level drops below its pre-drought monthly average. Simulation results suggest
    that holistic adaptive management can alleviate the impact of drought on agricultural
    production, hydropower generation, and the availability of water for residential
    consumption.'

  container-title: Texas A&M Law Review
  page: 179-198
  volume: '6'
  status: published
  abstract: When public governance fails to address important environmental threats—such
    as climate change—private governance by firms, not-for-profits, individuals, and
    households can produce significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Private
    governance can take the form of either a carrot or a stick, using incentives or
    punishments. Shareholder activism as a form of private governance of corporations
    has largely been confrontational, leading most climate-related actions to fail.
    This Article examines the potential for private governance to take a more collaborative
    approach and to frame shareholder engagement with management in terms of opportunity.
    It also examines private governance successes at reducing household emissions
    and finds that these too emphasize making it attractive and convenient for households
    to act.

  title: Urban water conservation policies in the United States
  container-title: Earth’s Future
  page: 955-967
  volume: '6'
  status: published
  abstract: Urban water supply systems in the United States are increasingly stressed
    as economic and population growth confront limited water resources. Demand management,
    through conservation and improved efficiency, has long been promoted as a practical
    alternative to building Promethean energy-intensive water-supply infrastructure.
    Some cities are making great progress at managing their demand, but study of conservation
    policies has been limited and often regionally focused. We present a hierarchical
    Bayesian analysis of a new measure of urban water conservation policy, the Vanderbilt
    Water Conservation Index (VWCI), for 195 cities in 45 states in the contiguous
    United States. This study does not attempt to establish causal relationships,
    but does observe that cities in states with arid climates tend to adopt more conservation
    measures. Within a state, cities with more Democratic-leaning voting preferences
    and large and rapidly growing populations tend to adopt more conservation measures.
    Economic factors and climatic differences between cities do not correlate with
    the number of measures adopted, but they do correlate with the character of the
    measures, with arid cities favoring mandatory conservation actions and cities
    in states with lower real personal income favoring rebates for voluntary actions.
    Understanding relationships between environmental and societal factors and cities’
    support for water conservation measures can help planners and policy-makers identify
    obstacles and opportunities to increase the role of conservation and efficiency
    in making urban water supply systems sustainable.

  page: 1065-1083
  volume: '12'

  status: published
  abstract: Employee energy benefits (EEBs), such as subsidies for employee home energy
    audits and financial incentives for carpooling to work, aim to influence employees’
    environmental behaviors outside of work. Exploring these understudied benefits
    would offer new insights that can enrich theories of employer and employee motivations
    for engaging in environmental behavior, as well as reveal new strategies for making
    significant progress on environment goals. By drawing upon employer reports and
    conducting a survey of 482 US adults employed full-time, we found that there are
    a wide range of types of EEBs currently offered by employers, and furthermore,
    they were more likely to be offered in certain industries, such as state and local
    governments but not others such as retail. These benefits were offered to 17%
    of employees and included a vast array of strategies and approaches. Guided by
    theorizing on employer and employee motivation, open-ended responses suggested
    employers were perceived to offer EEBs to maximize competiveness and because of
    social responsibility concerns, and employees tended to enroll because they wanted
    to save money and time or because they cared about the environment. Finally, EEBs
    were linked to employee environmental behavior and morale. The findings reveal
    new information about the types of EEBs being offered, motivations for offering
    and enrolling in EEBs, and their relationship to employee behavior and morale.
    This work suggests numerous lines of promising new research.

    distinct agro-ecological systems, climates, and cloud coverage: Sri Lanka and
    California. Performance in California is higher because of more cloud-free days
    and less missing data. In both regions, the correlation between the actual and

    of favorable public image and reduced operational costs from energy and other
    savings. On September 5, 2018, ELI held an expert panel discussing the role of

    actors pursuing carbon reduction initiatives, key factors in successful case studies,
    and methods for developing and evaluating successful private climate initiatives.

  volume: '86'
  status: published
  abstract: Law is generally represented through text, and lawyers have for centuries
    classified large bodies of legal text into distinct topics — they “topic model”
    the law. But large bodies of legal documents present challenges for conventional
    topic modeling methods. The task of gathering, reviewing, coding, sorting, and
    assessing a body of tens of thousands of legal documents is a daunting proposition.
    Recent advances in computational text analytics, a subset of the field of “artificial
    intelligence,” are already gaining traction in legal practice settings such as
    e-discovery by leveraging the speed and capacity of computers to process enormous
    bodies of documents. Differences between conventional and computational methods,
    however, suggest that computational text modeling has its own limitations, but
    that the two methods used in unison could be a powerful research tool for legal
    scholars in their research as well.

  abstract: Climate change is a *global* problem. Food, water, health, housing, and
    life are basic *individual* human rights. However, *between* the global forces
    of climate change and individual challenges of meeting basic needs, communities
    are the context in which people experience the effects of climate change and seek
    to adapt to its impact on their livelihoods. Such adaptation may include permanent
    migration and certainly, this has been one of the foci of international relations
    and security politics related to climate change. Of course, such migration will
    have human rights consequences and there are human rights causes to some of this
    migration as well. Of equal importance, but gaining less attention, are the problems
    related to climate change effects that do not cause mass migration, that may include
    short-term seasonal migration, and that also have human rights causes and consequences.
    In this chapter, we use a study in rural Bangladesh to demonstrate the import
    of the human rights considerations of this second, community-level, impact of
    climate change on human rights. We find that the human rights impacts of slow
    and rapid onset environmental change are a function of democratic, social, and
    economic rights, that is, those human rights that are best understood as enjoyed
    *through* political community are equally worthy of our rights attention because
    they are essential to climate change adaptation.

  note: 494 pp.
  abstract: Private sector action provides one of the most promising opportunities
    to reduce the risks of climate change, buying time while governments move slowly
    or even oppose climate mitigation. Starting with the insight that much of the
    resistance to climate mitigation is grounded in concern about the role of government,
    this books draws on law, policy, social science, and climate science to demonstrate
    how private initiatives are already bypassing government inaction in the US and
    around the globe. It makes a persuasive case that private governance can reduce
    global carbon emissions by a billion tons per year over the next decade. Combining
    an examination of the growth of private climate initiatives over the last decade,
    a theory of why private actors are motivated to reduce emissions, and a review
    of viable next steps, this book speaks to scholars, business and advocacy group
    managers, philanthropists, policymakers, and anyone interested in climate change.

  title: Widespread infilling of tidal channels and navigable waterways in the human-modified
    tidal deltaplain of southwest Bangladesh
  container-title: Elementa
  page: '78'
  volume: '5'
  status: published
  abstract: Since the 1960s, $\sim 5000~\text{km}^2$ of tidal deltaplain in southwest
    Bangladesh has been embanked and converted to densely inhabited, agricultural
    islands (i.e., polders). This landscape is juxtaposed to the adjacent Sundarbans,
    a pristine mangrove forest, both well connected by a dense network of tidal channels
    that effectively convey water and sediment throughout the region. The extensive
    embanking in poldered areas, however, has greatly reduced the tidal prism (i.e.,
    volume of water) transported through local channels. We reveal that $>600~\text{km}$
    of these major waterways have infilled in recent decades, converting to land through
    enhanced sedimentation and the direct blocking of waterways by embankments and
    sluice gates. Nearly all of the observed closures ($\sim 98\%$) have occurred
    along the embanked polder systems, with no comparable changes occurring in channels
    of the Sundarbans ($<2\%$ change). We attribute most of the channel infilling
    to the local reduction of tidal prism in poldered areas and the associated decline
    in current velocities. The infilled channels account for $\sim 90~\text{km}^2$
    of new land in the last 40–50 years, the rate of which, $\sim 2~\text{km}^2/\text{yr}$,
    offsets the $4~\text{km}^2/\text{yr}$ that is eroded at the coast, and is equivalent
    to $\sim 20\%$ of the new land produced naturally at the Ganges-Brahmaputra tidal
    rivermouth. Most of this new land, called ‘khas’ in Bengali, has been reclaimed
    for agriculture or aquaculture, contributing to the local economy. However, benefits
    are tempered by the loss of navigable waterways for commerce, transportation,
    and fishing, as well as the forced rerouting of tidal waters and sediments necessary
    to sustain this low-lying landscape against rising sea level. A more sustainable
    delta will require detailed knowledge of the consequences of these hydrodynamic
    changes to support more scientifically-grounded management of water, sediment,
    and tidal energy distribution.

  abstract: National drinking water assessments for Bangladesh do not reflect local
    variability, or temporal differences. This paper reports on the findings of an
    interdisciplinary investigation of drinking water insecurity in a rural coastal
    south-western Bangladesh. Drinking water quality is assessed by comparison of
    locally measured concentrations to national levels and water quality criteria;
    resident’s access to potable water and their perceptions are based on local social
    surveys. Residents in the study area use groundwater far less than the national
    average; salinity and local rainwater scarcity necessitates the use of multiple
    water sources throughout the year. Groundwater concentrations of arsenic and specific
    conductivity (SpC) were greater than surface water (pond) concentrations; there
    was no statistically significant seasonal difference in mean concentrations in
    groundwater, but there was for ponds, with arsenic higher in the dry season. Average
    arsenic concentrations in local water drinking were 2–4 times times the national
    average. All of the local groundwater samples exceeded the Bangladesh guidance
    for SpC, although the majority of residents surveyed did not perceive their water
    as having a “bad” or “salty” taste.

  abstract: 'Drought and water scarcity are growing challenges to agriculture around
    the world. Farmers can adapt through both individual and community-based collective
    actions. We draw on extensive field-work conducted with paddy farmers in rural
    Sri Lanka to study adaptations to water scarcity, including switching to less
    water-intensive crops, farming collectively on shared land, and individually turning
    to groundwater by digging wells. We explore how variability in climate affects
    agricultural decision-making at the community and individual levels using three
    types of decision-making, each characterized by an objective function: risk-averse
    expected utility, regret-adjusted expected utility, and prospect theory loss-aversion.
    We also assess how the introduction of individualized access to irrigation water
    with wells affects community-based drought mitigation practices. Preliminary results
    suggest that the growth of well-irrigation may produce sudden disruptions to community-based
    adaptations, but that this depends on the mental models farmers use to think about
    risk and make decisions under uncertainty.'

  volume: '77'
  status: published
  abstract: Droughts affect more people than any other natural disaster. Drought severity
    is not merely a function of precipitation; it emerges from a web of interrelations
    between human and natural systems. The impacts of drought are equally complex,
    shifting across temporal scales, economic sectors, and regions. Even in regions
    with similar hydroclimatic characteristics, there is tremendous variation in the
    effects of drought. This study combines satellite imagery, geospatial data, and
    qualitative data to identify the multi-scalar factors that drive variations in
    agricultural responses to drought. We analyzed eleven years of remotely sensed
    imagery to identify agricultural areas in which cultivation occurred during an
    extreme drought in Sri Lanka. We visited a subset of these communities and conducted
    interviews with officials and farmers to identify the factors that influenced
    agricultural adaptation. Results suggest that though structural factors such as
    infrastructural capacity and physical environment significantly affect agricultural
    adaptation, dynamic factors such as local control of water supply, perceived risk,
    community cohesion, and farmer experience explain significant variation in the
    adaptive capacity of agricultural systems.

  title: Application of machine learning to the prediction of vegetation health
  container-title: ISPRS—International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing
    and Spatial Information Sciences
  page: 465-469
  volume: XLI-B2
  status: published
  abstract: This project applies machine learning techniques to remotely sensed imagery
    to train and validate predictive models of vegetation health in Bangladesh and
    Sri Lanka. For both locations, we downloaded and processed eleven years of imagery
    from multiple MODIS datasets which were combined and transformed into two-dimensional
    matrices. We applied a gradient boosted machines model to the lagged dataset values
    to forecast future values of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). The predictive
    power of raw spectral data MODIS products were compared across time periods and
    land use categories. Our models have significantly more predictive power on held-out
    datasets than a baseline. Though the tool was built to increase capacity to monitor
    vegetation health in data scarce regions like South Asia, users may include ancillary
    spatiotemporal datasets relevant to their region of interest to increase predictive
    power and to facilitate interpretation of model results. The tool can automatically
    update predictions as new MODIS data is made available by NASA. The tool is particularly
    well-suited for decision makers interested in understanding and predicting vegetation
    health dynamics in countries in which environmental data is scarce and cloud cover
    is a significant concern.

  container-title: International Journal of Climatology
  page: 563-575
  volume: '36'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: A spatiotemporal analysis of two well-known agricultural drought indices,
    the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and the Standardized Precipitation Index
    at a 9-month scale (SPI-9), is presented for Sri Lanka. The analysis was conducted
    based on monthly precipitation and temperature data from January 1881 to December
    2010 using 13 stations distributed across the three climatic zones of the country.
    Principal component analysis shows that the first two principal components of
    PDSI and SPI-9 are spatially comparable and could physically represent the two
    main monsoons. A wavelet analysis of these principal components’ scores for both
    indices indicates a stronger association between the Northeastern monsoon and
    El-Niño in recent decades. Correlation analysis with agricultural metrics suggests
    that different indices might be appropriate for each of the climatic zones in
    Sri Lanka. PDSI correlated best with the intermediate zone districts; SPI-9 correlated
    best with the dry zone districts; but neither index correlated well with the wet
    zone districts.

  page: 807-827
  volume: '31'
  status: published
  abstract: Although there are multiple causes of the water scarcity crisis in the
    American Southwest, it can be used as a model of the long-term problem of freshwater
    shortages that climate change will exacerbate. We examine the water-supply crisis
    for 22 cities in the extended Southwest of the United States and develop a unique,
    new measure of water conservation policies and programs. Convergent qualitative
    and quantitative analyses suggest that political conflicts play an important role
    in the transition of water-supply regimes toward higher levels of demandreduction
    policies and programs. Qualitative analysis using institutional theory identifies
    the interaction of four types of motivating logics—development, rural preservation,
    environmental, and urban consumer—and shows how demand-reduction strategies can
    potentially satisfy all four. Quantitative analysis of the explanatory factors
    for the variation in the adoption of demand-reduction policies points to the overwhelming
    importance of political preferences as defined by Cook’s Partisan Voting Index.
    We suggest that approaches to water-supply choices are influenced less by direct
    partisan disagreements than by broad preferences for a development logic based
    on supplyincrease strategies and discomfort with demand-reduction strategies that
    clash with conservative beliefs.

  abstract: Despite much scientific evidence, a large fraction of the American public
    doubts that greenhouse gases are causing global warming. We present a simulation
    model as a computational test-bed for climate prediction markets. Traders adapt
    their beliefs about future temperatures based on the profits of other traders
    in their social network. We simulate two alternative climate futures, in which
    global temperatures are primarily driven either by carbon dioxide or by solar
    irradiance. These represent, respectively, the scientific consensus and a hypothesis
    advanced by prominent skeptics. We conduct sensitivity analyses to determine how
    a variety of factors describing both the market and the physical climate may affect
    traders’ beliefs about the cause of global climate change. Market participation
    causes most traders to converge quickly toward believing the "true" climate model,
    suggesting that a climate market could be useful for building public consensus.

  abstract: Between the national and household factors, community or “meso-level”
    changes in political economy and livelihoods in southwestern Bangladesh illustrate
    that in order to understand the impacts on people and nations of climate change-related
    environmental changes—changes that are expected to include rising sea level, saline
    inundation, and increased likelihood and intensity of cyclones in Bangladesh—we
    need to understand the dynamics of the built and natural environment and the political
    economies these sustain. Meso-level political economies affect the sources of
    income and livelihood available in distressed environmental conditions, and therefore
    influence how well the people in them can adapt to changing environmental conditions.
    In this study we have seen the underlying political economies whose dynamics,
    and not slow onset environmental changes or disastrous environmental events, are
    pushing Bangladeshis to incorporate migration strategies into their livelihood
    strategies.

  title: Flood risk of natural and embanked landscapes on the Ganges-Brahmaputra tidal
    delta plain
  container-title: Nature Climate Change
  page: 152-157
  volume: '5'
  issue: '2'
  status: published
  abstract: The Ganges-Brahmaputra river delta, with 170 million people and a vast,
    low-lying coastal plain, is perceived to be at great risk of increased flooding
    and submergence from sea-level rise. However, human alteration of the landscape
    can create similar risks to sea-level rise. Here, we report that islands in southwest
    Bangladesh, enclosed by embankments in the 1960s, have lost 1.0–1.5m of elevation,
    whereas the neighbouring Sundarban mangrove forest has remained comparatively
    stable. We attribute this elevation loss to interruption of sedimentation inside
    the embankments, combined with accelerated compaction, removal of forest biomass,
    and a regionally increased tidal range. One major consequence of this elevation
    loss occurred in 2009 when the embankments of several large islands failed during
    Cyclone Aila, leaving large areas of land tidally inundated for up to two years
    until embankments were repaired. Despite sustained human suering during this time,
    the newly reconnected landscape received tens of centimetres of tidally deposited
    sediment, equivalent to decades’ worth of normal sedimentation. Although many
    areas still lie well below mean high water and remain at risk of severe flooding,
    we conclude that elevation recovery may be possible through controlled embankment
    breaches.

  abstract: Flood-control measures, such as levees and floodwalls, can backfire and
    increase risks of disastrous floods by giving the public a false sense of security
    and thus encouraging people to build valuable property in high-risk locations.
    More generally, nonlinear interactions between human land-use and natural processes
    can produce unexpected emergent phenomena in coupled human-natural systems (CHNS).
    We describe a participatory agent-based simulation of coupled urban development
    and flood risks and discuss the potential of this simulation to help educate a
    wide range of the public—from middle- and high-school students to public officials—about
    emergence in CHNS and present results from two pilot studies.

  title: Water conservation and hydrological transitions in cities in the United States
  container-title: Water Resources Research
  page: 4635-4649
  volume: '51'
  issue: '6'
  status: published
  abstract: Cities across the world have had to diversify and expand their water supply
    systems in response to demand growth, groundwater depletion and pollution, and
    instability and inadequacy of regional surface freshwater sources. In the U.S.,
    these problems plague not only the arid Western cities but increasingly also cities
    in the Eastern portions of the country. Although cities continue to seek out new
    sources of water via Promethean projects of long-distance supply systems, desalinization
    plants, and the recharge of aquifers with surface water, they also pursue water
    conservation because of its low cost and other benefits. We examine water conservation
    as a complex sociotechnical system comprising interactions of political, sociodemographic,
    economic, and hydroclimatological factors. We provide quantitative data on the
    factors that affect more and less advanced transitions in water conservation regimes,
    and we show that water stress and other hydrological data can only partially predict
    the transition. We also provide qualitative case studies to identify institutional
    and political barriers to more advanced water conservation regimes. This interdisciplinary,
    mixed methods approach typifies the need for knowledge that informs hydrologists
    about how their research may or may not be adopted by decision-makers.

  abstract: This article outlines a method for automatically generating models of
    dynamic decision-making that both have strong predictive power and are interpretable
    in human terms. This is useful for designing empirically grounded agent-based
    simulations and for gaining direct insight into observed dynamic processes. We
    use an efficient model representation and a genetic algorithm-based estimation
    process to generate simple approximations that explain most of the structure of
    complex stochastic processes. This method, implemented in C^++^ and R, scales
    well to large data sets. We apply our methods to empirical data from human subjects
    game experiments and international relations. We also demonstrate the method’s
    ability to recover known data-generating processes by simulating data with agent-based
    models and correctly deriving the underlying decision models for multiple agent
    models and degrees of stochasticity.

  note: '**<span class="smallcaps">Note:</span>** This paper won the 2017 Morrison
    Prize for the highest-impact paper on sustainability law and policy in 2015'
  abstract: This Article examines how private governance can bypass government gridlock
    on climate change and buy time for a national and international carbon price.
    A carbon price—whether in the form of a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade program—is
    the optimal government response but is unlikely to be implemented within the next
    decade. Likely government policies will reduce emissions by far less than needed
    to reduce the risk of significant climate disruption, but recent corporate carbon
    disclosure programs, supply chain contracting requirements, investor pressure,
    and other private initiatives demonstrate the viability of another approach. Private
    initiatives can reduce carbon emissions without the coercive power or resources
    of government by correcting market and behavioral failures and by drawing on the
    support for mitigation that exists in a subset of the population. The Article
    demonstrates how a private governance wedge of emissions reductions can be achieved
    by expanding current corporate and household private governance initiatives and
    by launching new initiatives that address climate beliefs, motivations, and behavior.
    Private initiatives can bypass ideological barriers and national boundaries, but
    implementing a private climate governance strategy will require relaxing the assumption
    that only governments can drive major emissions reductions over the next decade.

  container-title: Virginia Environmental Law Journal
  page: 1-26
  volume: '32'
  status: published
  abstract: 'This Essay argues for consideration of political opportunity costs in
    the criteria used to evaluate climate policy instruments. Law and policy debates
    typically evaluate policy instruments by their expected performance after adoption,
    tacitly excluding consideration of the timing of adoption. Under this standard,
    a comprehensive carbon pricing instrument, either in the form of a cap and trade
    program or a carbon tax, has emerged as the preferred approach. Yet by excluding
    the political process from consideration, this standard obscures the effects of
    political feasibility on the timing of adoption. For many problems, the advantages
    of an optimal policy outweigh the advantages of a sub-optimal one that will require
    less time and effort to adopt. The climate problem is different: the irreversibility
    of climate change, the possibility of tipping points in the climate system, and
    lag times in infrastructure investments combine to impose large costs on delay.
    Excluding political opportunity costs from instrument evaluation leads to a preference
    for slow, comprehensive remedies. The casualties in this process are incremental
    instruments that could buy time, facilitate the adoption of additional instruments,
    and complement those instruments after they are adopted. This Essay proposes explicit
    consideration of political opportunity costs in evaluating climate policy instruments
    and applies this approach to several leading climate policies.'

  container-title: UCLA Law Review
  page: 1962-2017
  volume: '61'
  status: published
  abstract: 'Much of energy policy is driven by concerns about climate change. Views
    about the importance of carbon emissions affect debates on topics ranging from
    the regulation of electricity generation and transmission to the need for incentives
    to develop and promote emerging technologies. Government efforts to fund and communicate
    climate science have been extraordinary, but recent polling suggests that roughly
    half of the American population is unsure or does not believe that anthropogenic
    climate change is occurring. Among some populations belief in climate change is
    declining even as the climate science becomes more certain. Much of the doubt
    occurs among individuals who support free markets, and the doubt is fueled by
    the argument that governments and government-funded climate scientists are not
    accounting for information that is inconsistent with the climate consensus. This
    Article explores a private governance response: the creation of a prediction market
    to assess and communicate the implications of climate science. Markets not only
    allow the buying and selling of goods, they provide information about the likelihood
    of future events. Research suggests that markets are often able to account for
    information that is outside of the conventional wisdom. In addition, individuals
    who are likely to doubt climate science may find markets to be credible sources
    of information. A climate market could take the form of an academic initiative
    along the lines of the Iowa presidential prediction market or could operate as
    a more traditional options market. Trading could occur over the types of predictions
    that matter for global climate change, such as the global average temperature
    or sea level in 2020 or 2100, with the current market value of the prediction
    signaling the likelihood of the outcome. The market will be subject to manipulation
    concerns, but experience with other prediction markets suggests that a climate
    prediction market has the potential to provide an accurate, credible and widely-disseminated
    signal about the status of the climate science.'

  abstract: Environmental vulnerability in Bangladesh—especially vulnerability to
    climate change—is too often treated in isolation from the social, economic, and
    political contexts in which communities and their inhabitants make their livelihood.
    We propose that resilience and vulnerability to environmental stress are best
    understood in terms of a modification of Ostrom’s socioecological systems paradigm
    that we call “multiple dynamic equilibria:” livelihoods in vulnerable regions
    are shaped by multiple overlapping patterns of interaction between the physical
    environment in which people live and the social, economic, and political environments
    in which they interact, within their communities, with other communities, and
    external actors. Translating policy goals into effective action requires understanding
    these interactions at multiple levels. We report on a new transdisciplinary project
    that draws geoscientists, engineers, and social scientists together to investigate
    the interactions between communities and the environment in the southwestern coastal
    region of Bangladesh and understand the dynamics of vulnerability and resilience.

  abstract: Deltas are dynamic landforms that have been the foci of agri- and aquacultural
    development by humans for millennia. The dynamics of deltas are governed by changes
    in river discharge and reworking of sediment. While these dynamics make deltas
    highly productive areas, they also present challenges to farming practices, often
    resulting in complicated feedbacks. These dynamics include river and coastal flooding,
    compaction, subsidence, salinization, and moving land-water boundaries. Likewise,
    farming in a dynamic environment can lead to socio-economic conflicts. Adaptation
    to these constantly changing variables requires flexible farming practices that
    must keep pace with changing climate.

  abstract: 'The individual and household sector accounts for roughly 40 percent of
    United States energy use and carbon dioxide emissions, yet the laws and policies
    directed at reductions from this sector often reflect a remarkably simplistic
    model of behavior. This Essay addresses one of the obstacles to achieving a “behavioral
    wedge”behavioral wedge of individual and household emissions reductions: the lack
    of an accessible, brief summary for policymakers of the key findings of behavioral
    and social science studies on household energy behavior. The Essay does not provide
    a comprehensive overview of the field, but it discusses many of the leading studies
    that demonstrate the extent and limits of rational action. These studies can inform
    lawyers and policymakers who are developing measures to reduce energy use and
    carbon emissions and can serve as an entry point for more detailed studies of
    the literature.An effective response to the climate change problem will require
    substantial reductions in energy demand in addition to new developments in low-carbon
    energy supplies.1 The individual and household sector presents a major opportunity:
    the sector accounts for roughly 40Despite this opportunity, recent regulatory
    and policy efforts are only beginning to direct substantial attention to the individual
    and household sector. Findings from the social sciences provide valuable insights
    into how to capitalize on this opportunity, yet policymakers often have little
    time to develop new polices and are confronted with a barrage of often-conflicting
    approaches and theories. This Essay addresses the policy-making challenge by distilling
    the findings from a broad range of fields into several key principles for those
    developing energy and climate laws and policies. The principles we outline here
    are a starting point for policymakers working in this area. We attempt to provide
    insight into which principles are most relevant to law and policy, but instructions
    as to how to incorporate these principles are beyond the scope of this essay.
    The principles include only a subset of the insights from the behavioral and social
    science literature. In many cases, adherence to multiple principles will be necessary
    to develop the most effective policy design. Policymakers should consult the body
    of work referenced here, as well as experts in the social sciences to further
    their understanding of these and other principles. More extensive reviews of this
    literature and its relevance to energy and climate policy are also available.'

  title: Time-resolved light scattering measurements of cartilage and cornea denaturation
    due to free-electron laser radiation
  container-title: Journal of Biomedical Optics
  page: 216-222
  volume: '8'
  issue: '2'
  status: published
  abstract: Light scattering is used to monitor the dynamics and energy thresholds
    of laser-induced structural alterations in biopolymers due to irradiation by a
    free electron laser (FEL) in the infrared (IR) wavelength range 2.2 to 8.5 $\mu$m.
    Attenuated total reflectance (ATR) Fourier-transform IR (FTIR) spectroscopy is
    used to examine infrared tissue absorption spectra before and after irradiation.
    Light scattering by bovine and porcine cartilage and cornea samples is measured
    in real time during FEL irradiation using a 650-nm diode laser and a diode photoarray
    with time resolution of 10 ms. The data on the time dependence of light scattering
    in the tissue are modeled to estimate the approximate values of kinetic parameters
    for denaturation as functions of laser wavelength and radiant exposure. We found
    that the denaturation threshold is slightly lower for cornea than for cartilage,
    and both depend on laser wavelength. An inverse correlation between denaturation
    thresholds and the absorption spectrum of the tissue is observed for many wavelengths;
    however, for wavelengths near 3 and 6 $\mu$m, the denaturation threshold does
    not exhibit the inverse correlation, instead being governed by heating kinetics
    of tissue. It is shown that light scattering is useful for measuring the denaturation
    thresholds and dynamics for different biotissues, except where the initial absorptivity
    is very high.

  abstract: Hydrogen chemistry in thin films and biological systems is one of the
    most difficult experimental problems in today’s science and technology. We successfully
    tested a novel solution, based on the spectroscopic version of scanning near-field
    optical microscopy (SNOM). The tunable infrared radiation of the Vanderbilt free-electron
    laser enabled us to reveal clearly hydrogen-decorated grain boundaries on nominally
    hydrogen-free diamond films. The images were obtained by SNOM detection of reflected
    3.5 micron photons, corresponding to the C-H stretch absorption, and reached a
    lateral resolution of 0.2 micron, well below the $\lambda/2$ ($\lambda$ = wavelength)
    limit of classical microscopy.

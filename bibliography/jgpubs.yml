- abstract: As researchers collect large amounts of data in the social
    sciences through household surveys, challenges may arise in how best
    to analyze such datasets, especially where motivating theories are
    unclear or conflicting. New analytical methods may be necessary to
    extract information from these datasets. Machine learning techniques
    are promising methods for identifying patterns in large datasets,
    but have not yet been widely used to identify important variables in
    social surveys with many questions. To demonstrate the potential of
    machine learning to analyze large social datasets, we apply machine
    learning techniques to the study of migration in Bangladesh. The
    complexity of migration decisions makes them suitable for analysis
    with machine learning techniques, which enable pattern
    identification in large datasets with many covariates. In this
    paper, we apply random forest methods to analyzing a large survey
    which captures approximately 2000 variables from approximately 1700
    households in southwestern Bangladesh. Our analysis ranked the
    covariates in the dataset in terms of their predictive power for
    migration decisions. The results identified the most important
    covariates, but there exists a tradeoff between predictive ability
    and interpretability. To address this tradeoff, random forests and
    other machine learning algorithms may be especially useful in
    combination with more traditional regression methods. To develop
    insights into how the important variables identified by the random
    forest algorithm impact migration, we performed a survival analysis
    of household time to first migration. With this combined analysis,
    we found that variables related to wealth and household composition
    are important predictors of migration. Such multi-methods approaches
    may help to shed light on factors contributing to migration and
    non-migration.

- abstract: The decision to migrate is complex and is often influenced
    by a combination of economic, social, political, and environmental
    pressures. Household survey instruments can capture detailed
    information about migration histories and their contexts, but it can
    be challenging to identify important predictors from large numbers
    of covariates with standard statistical methods, such as regression
    analyses. Machine learning techniques are well suited to pattern
    identification and can identify important covariates from large
    datasets. We report on the application of machine learning
    approaches to two large surveys collected from a total of more than
    2800 households in southwestern Bangladesh. We applied random forest
    classification and regression models to identify significant
    covariates with the greatest predictive power for household
    migration decisions. The results show that random forest models are
    able to identify nuances in predictors of different types of
    migration and migration in different communities. Random forests
    also outperform logistic regression and support vector machines in
    predicting migration in all cases analyzed. Therefore, random forest
    models and other machine learning methods can be useful for
    improving the predictive accuracy of migration models and
    identifying patterns in complex social datasets. Future work should
    continue to explore the potential of machine learning techniques
    applied to questions of environmental migration.

- abstract: Environmental change interacts with population migration in
    complex ways that depend on interactions between impacts on
    individual households and on communities. These coupled
    individual-collective dynamics make agent-based simulations useful
    for studying environmental migration. We present an original
    agent-based model that simulates environment-migration dynamics in
    terms of the impacts of natural hazards on labor markets in rural
    communities, with households deciding whether to migrate based on
    maximizing their expected income. We use a pattern-oriented approach
    that seeks to reproduce observed patterns of environmentally-driven
    migration in Bangladesh. The model is parameterized with empirical
    data and unknown parameters are calibrated to reproduce the observed
    patterns. This model can reproduce these patterns, but only for a
    narrow range of parameters. Future work will compare
    income-maximizing decisions to psychologically complex decision
    heuristics that include non-economic considerations.

- abstract: The impact of human activities and climate change occurs
    across a range of spatial and temporal scales, and the city or
    regional scale is critical for managing food-energy-water (FEW)
    resources. We develop a coupled human-natural system model for Cape
    Town, South Africa, which consists of an agent-based model and a
    regional hydrologic model, to study the FEW nexus connecting the
    agricultural, urban, and hydroelectric generation sectors. We use
    the model to compare three policies---a simple adaptive approach,
    adaptation with free water to indigent households, and water supply
    augmentation---and assess their ability to provide reliable FEW
    services to the different stakeholders under four different climate
    scenarios, representing moderate to severe amounts of warming. Our
    results indicate that Cape Town is likely to face increasing water
    stress as temperatures rise, and that adaptation strategies could
    effectively mitigate the effects of water limitations and avoid
    severe failures in providing FEW services across sectors. One way to
    manage demand for FEW services is by adjusting water price tariffs,
    but high prices create inequality in access to water for households
    with different incomes. Our analysis suggests that the water supply
    system in Cape Town may already be at, if not over, its sustainable
    capacity within the FEW nexus. Our model serves as a test-bed for
    assessing policies to manage stresses on water resources for the
    benefit of stakeholders across FEW sectors. This model can be
    adapted to cities and regions around the globe.

- abstract: "Hazards and disasters arise from interactions between
    environmental and social processes so interdisciplinary research is
    crucial to understanding and effectively managing them. Despite
    support and encouragement from funding agencies, universities, and
    journals and growing interest from researchers, interdisciplinary
    disaster research teams face significant obstacles, such as the
    difficulty of establishing effective communication and understanding
    across disciplines. Better understanding of interdisciplinary
    teamwork can also have important practical benefits for operational
    disaster planning and response.Social studies of science
    distinguishes different kinds of expertise and different modes of
    communication. Understanding these differences can help
    interdisciplinary research teams communicate more clearly and work
    together more effectively. The primary role of a researcher is in
    *contributory expertise*contributory expertise (the ability to make
    original contributions to a discipline); but *interactional
    expertise*interactional expertise in other disciplines (the ability
    to understand their literature and communicate with their
    practitioners) can play an important role in interdisciplinary
    collaborations. Developing interactional expertise requires
    considerable time and effort, which can be challenging for a busy
    researcher, and also requires a foundation of trust and
    communication among team members. Three distinct aspects of
    communication play important roles in effective interdisciplinary
    communication: *dialects*dialects, *metaphors*metaphors, and
    *articulation*articulation.There are different ways to develop
    interactional expertise and effective communication, so researchers
    can pursue approaches that suit their circumstances. It will be
    important for future research on interdisciplinary disaster research
    to identify best practices for building trust, facilitating
    communication, and developing interactional expertise."

- abstract: Public transit agencies struggle to maintain transit
    accessibility with reduced resources, unreliable ridership data,
    reduced vehicle capacities due to social distancing, and reduced
    services due to driver unavailability. In collaboration with transit
    agencies from two large metropolitan areas in the USA, we are
    designing novel approaches for addressing the afore-mentioned
    challenges by collecting accurate real-time ridership data,
    providing guidance to commuters, and performing operational
    optimization for public transit. We estimate rider-ship data using
    historical automated passenger counting data, conditional on a set
    of relevant determinants. Accurate ridership forecasting is
    essential to optimize the public transit schedule, which is
    necessary to improve current fixed lines with on-demand transit.
    Also, passenger crowding has been a problem for public
    transportation since it deteriorates passengers' wellbeing and
    satisfaction. During the COVID-19 pandemic, passenger crowding has
    gained importance since it represents a risk for social distancing
    violations. Therefore, we are creating optimization models to ensure
    that social distancing norms can be adequately followed while
    ensuring that the total demand for transit is met. We will then use
    accurate forecasts for operational optimization that includes (a)
    proactive fixed-line schedule optimization based on predicted
    demand, (b) dispatch of on-demand micro-transit, prioritizing
    at-risk populations, and (c) allocation of vehicles to transit and
    cargo trips, considering exigent vehicle maintenance requirements
    (i.e., disinfection). Finally, this paper presents some initial
    results from our project regarding the estimation of ridership in
    public transit.

- abstract: The paper examines a scenario exercise concerning deployment
    of solar geoengineering by a small group of states that are
    particularly vulnerable to climate change. Two groups of
    participants were each asked to provide expert decision-making
    advice to an alliance comprising great powers, and to propose a
    political response to the deployment initiative. This paper
    discusses the initial governance proposals and examines differences
    and exchanges between the groups throughout the exercise. The two
    groups delivered distinct governance proposals. The differences,
    which were driven largely by divergent worldviews and assumptions
    about the geopolitical context, provide insights into the
    complexities of responses to the "free-driver" of solar
    geoengineering deployment, internal functioning and cohesion of
    coalitions, and interactions among multiple responses to climate
    change.

- abstract: Climate change interacts with social, economic, and
    political forces in ways that can shape demographic behavior. Yet,
    the link between environmental stress and marriage has received
    limited attention. Using survey data from 615 Bangladeshi
    households, we examine the relationship between extreme weather in
    the form of heat waves and dry spells, and the risk of marriage over
    the period from 1989 to 2013. We find that girls and women are at an
    increased risk of marrying in the year of or following heat waves.
    The link is strongest for women aged 18 to 23, and weakest for those
    11 to 14. We also explore the hypothesis that extreme weather leads
    families to accept less desirable marriage proposals for daughters.
    We find that those who wed during periods of extreme heat married
    into poorer households and to husbands with less education.
    Similarly, those who married during abnormally dry periods married
    men man with less education and who were more supportive of intimate
    partner violence. Together these results suggest that, when
    Bangladeshi families face environmental shocks, they cope by
    hastening the marriage of daughters or accepting less desirable
    marriage proposals. Such practices are likely to have long-term
    impacts on the health and well-being of women and children, and
    underscore the unique vulnerabilities faced by women as climate
    change intensifies.

- abstract: "Modeling is essential to characterize and explore complex
    societal and environmental issues in systematic and collaborative
    ways. Socio-environmental systems (SES) modeling integrates
    knowledge and perspectives into conceptual and computational tools
    that explicitly recognize how human decisions affect the
    environment. Depending on the modeling purpose, many SES modelers
    also realize that involvement of stakeholders and experts is
    fundamental to support social learning and decision-making processes
    for achieving improved environmental and social outcomes. The
    contribution of this paper lies in identifying and formulating grand
    challenges that need to be overcome to accelerate the development
    and adaptation of SES modeling. Eight challenges are delineated:
    bridging epistemologies across disciplines; multi-dimensional
    uncertainty assessment and management; scales and scaling issues;
    combining qualitative and quantitative methods and data; furthering
    the adoption and impacts of SES modeling on policy; capturing
    structural changes; representing human dimensions in SES; and
    leveraging new data types and sources. These challenges limit our
    ability to effectively use SES modeling to provide the knowledge and
    information essential for supporting decision making. Whereas some
    of these challenges are not unique to SES modeling and may be
    pervasive in other scientific fields, they still act as barriers as
    well as research opportunities for the SES modeling community. For
    each challenge, we outline basic steps that can be taken to surmount
    the underpinning barriers. Thus, the paper identifies priority
    research areas in SES modeling, chiefly related to progressing
    modeling products, processes and practices."

- abstract: The growing sense of urgency by the public for action to
    address climate change stands in stark contrast to the slow pace and
    limited accomplishments of national and international institutions
    to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Political institutions face
    significant structural barriers to taking strong and rapid action to
    cut emissions, but private environmental governance has potential to
    avoid those barriers and achieve rapid emissions reductions. It
    appears unlikely that private governance alone can reduce emissions
    enough to stabilize the climate, but it does have the potential to
    reduce emissions sufficiently and quickly enough to buy time for
    enacting more comprehensive public governance measures. In this
    Perspective, we review what is known about private governance,
    present a framework for analyzing private governance initiatives,
    outline the prospects of the framework for understanding and guiding
    private governance, and identify future research priorities for
    applying this framework.

- abstract: This Article examines the argument that climate change is a
    "super wicked" problem. It concludes that the wicked problem concept
    is best viewed as a rhetorical device that served a valuable
    function in arguing against technocratic hubris in the early 1970s
    but is unhelpful and possibly counterproductive as a tool for modern
    climate policy analysis. Richard Lazarus improved on this analysis
    by emphasizing the urgency of a climate response in his
    characterization of the climate problem as "super wicked." We
    suggest another approach based on Charles Lindblom's "science of
    muddling through." The muddling through approach supports the
    rhetorical points for which the original wicked problem concept was
    introduced and provides greater practical guidance for developing
    new laws and policies to address climate change and other complex
    and messy environmental problems.

- abstract: "Limiting global warming to 2`\\degree `{=latex}C or less
    compared with pre-industrial temperatures will require unprecedented
    rates of decarbonization globally. The scale and scope of
    transformational change required across sectors and actors in
    society raises critical questions of feasibility. Much of the
    literature on mitigation pathways addresses technological and
    economic aspects of feasibility, but overlooks the behavioral,
    cultural, and social factors that affect theoretical and practical
    mitigation pathways. We present a tripartite framework that
    \"unpacks\" the concept of mitigation pathways by distinguishing three
    factors that together determine actual mitigation: technical
    potential, initiative feasibility, and behavioral plasticity. The
    framework aims to integrate and streamline heterogeneous
    disciplinary research traditions toward a more comprehensive and
    transparent approach that will facilitate learning across
    disciplines and enable mitigation pathways to more fully reflect
    available knowledge. We offer three suggestions for integrating the
    tripartite framework into current research on climate change
    mitigation."

- abstract: This Essay provides a simple heuristic to enable public and
    private policymakers to focus on the most important climate
    mitigation options. Policymakers face a blizzard of information,
    advocacy, and policy options, and it is easy to lose sight of the
    forest for the trees. Many options are attractive on the surface but
    will not meaningfully address the problem or are unlikely to be
    adopted in the foreseeable future. If policymakers make the right
    decision when confronting three essential choices or forks in the
    road, though, the result will be 60% to 70% reductions in greenhouse
    gas emissions, an amount that will keep widely-adopted climate
    mitigation goals in reach. The three options are decarbonization of
    the electrical grid, electrification of the motor vehicle fleet, and
    electrification of buildings. International, national, and
    subnational officials, philanthropists, corporate executives,
    advocacy group leaders, and households have the ability to
    prioritize these three options in their regulatory, purchasing, and
    other actions. If they make the right choice on these three options,
    many other mistakes can be made without jeopardizing the chance to
    achieve widely-adopted emissions targets. If they make the wrong
    choice, few combinations of other viable options can achieve the
    needed reductions. In the face of a growing consensus that major,
    prompt emissions reductions are required, the forks in the road
    approach can provide policymakers with the mental framework
    necessary to make smart decisions and ignore the noise surrounding
    climate law and policy

- abstract: "This Article demonstrates that a new revolving door is
    emerging between environmental-advocacy groups and the private
    sector. Since the birth of the modern regulatory state, scholars
    have raised concerns that the revolving door between corporations
    and government agencies could induce government officials to pursue
    corporate interests rather than the public interest. The legal and
    political-science literatures have identified several benefits that
    may arise from the revolving door, but the thrust of the scholarship
    to date has emphasized the potential harms. Using several data
    sources, we demonstrate that as the private sector has begun to play
    an increasing role in environmental governance in recent years, a
    new revolving door has emerged between environmental-advocacy groups
    and corporations, institutional investment firms, and private equity
    firms. We demonstrate that this new revolving door is surprisingly
    common, and we examine the implications for the future of public and
    private environmental governance. Although this new revolving door
    creates new risks, we argue that it may turn on its head the central
    concern about the revolving door: The movement of environmental
    advocates into corporate management positions may play the role of
    greening corporate behavior and may accelerate the development of
    private environmental initiatives. We focus on the movement of
    employees in the environmental area---a new green revolving
    door---but we suggest that this new revolving door also may be
    emerging in labor, health and safety, and other regulatory areas."

- abstract: "Deep connections between water resources and food and
    energy production---the food-energy-water (FEW) nexus---complicate
    the challenge of sustainably managing an uncertain water supply. We
    present an agent-based model as a computational testbed for studying
    different approaches to managing the FEW nexus and apply the model
    to the 2017--2018 water crisis in Cape Town South Africa. We treat
    the FEW nexus connecting municipal water use by Cape Town residents,
    agricultural water use by vineyards, and hydroelectric generation.
    We compare two scenarios for responding to drought:
    business-as-usual (BAU), and holistic adaptive management (HAM),
    where BAU takes no action until the monthly supply is insufficient
    to meet demand, whereas HAM takes action by raising water tariffs
    when the reservoir storage level drops below its pre-drought monthly
    average. Simulation results suggest that holistic adaptive
    management can alleviate the impact of drought on agricultural
    production, hydropower generation, and the availability of water for
    residential consumption."

- abstract: When public governance fails to address important
    environmental threats---such as climate change---private governance
    by firms, not-for-profits, individuals, and households can produce
    significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Private
    governance can take the form of either a carrot or a stick, using
    incentives or punishments. Shareholder activism as a form of private
    governance of corporations has largely been confrontational, leading
    most climate-related actions to fail. This Article examines the
    potential for private governance to take a more collaborative
    approach and to frame shareholder engagement with management in
    terms of opportunity. It also examines private governance successes
    at reducing household emissions and finds that these too emphasize
    making it attractive and convenient for households to act.

- abstract: Urban water supply systems in the United States are
    increasingly stressed as economic and population growth confront
    limited water resources. Demand management, through conservation and
    improved efficiency, has long been promoted as a practical
    alternative to building Promethean energy-intensive water-supply
    infrastructure. Some cities are making great progress at managing
    their demand, but study of conservation policies has been limited
    and often regionally focused. We present a hierarchical Bayesian
    analysis of a new measure of urban water conservation policy, the
    Vanderbilt Water Conservation Index (VWCI), for 195 cities in 45
    states in the contiguous United States. This study does not attempt
    to establish causal relationships, but does observe that cities in
    states with arid climates tend to adopt more conservation measures.
    Within a state, cities with more Democratic-leaning voting
    preferences and large and rapidly growing populations tend to adopt
    more conservation measures. Economic factors and climatic
    differences between cities do not correlate with the number of
    measures adopted, but they do correlate with the character of the
    measures, with arid cities favoring mandatory conservation actions
    and cities in states with lower real personal income favoring
    rebates for voluntary actions. Understanding relationships between
    environmental and societal factors and cities' support for water
    conservation measures can help planners and policy-makers identify
    obstacles and opportunities to increase the role of conservation and
    efficiency in making urban water supply systems sustainable.

- abstract: Employee energy benefits (EEBs), such as subsidies for
    employee home energy audits and financial incentives for carpooling
    to work, aim to influence employees' environmental behaviors outside
    of work. Exploring these understudied benefits would offer new
    insights that can enrich theories of employer and employee
    motivations for engaging in environmental behavior, as well as
    reveal new strategies for making significant progress on environment
    goals. By drawing upon employer reports and conducting a survey of
    482 US adults employed full-time, we found that there are a wide
    range of types of EEBs currently offered by employers, and
    furthermore, they were more likely to be offered in certain
    industries, such as state and local governments but not others such
    as retail. These benefits were offered to 17% of employees and
    included a vast array of strategies and approaches. Guided by
    theorizing on employer and employee motivation, open-ended responses
    suggested employers were perceived to offer EEBs to maximize
    competiveness and because of social responsibility concerns, and
    employees tended to enroll because they wanted to save money and
    time or because they cared about the environment. Finally, EEBs were
    linked to employee environmental behavior and morale. The findings
    reveal new information about the types of EEBs being offered,
    motivations for offering and enrolling in EEBs, and their
    relationship to employee behavior and morale. This work suggests
    numerous lines of promising new research.

- abstract: "Drought threatens food and water security around the world,
    and this threat is likely to become more severe under climate
    change. High-resolution predictive information can help farmers,
    water managers, and others to manage the effects of drought. We have
    created an open-source tool to produce short-term forecasts of
    vegetation health at high spatial resolution, using data that are
    global in coverage. The tool automates downloading and processing
    Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data sets and
    training gradient-boosted machine models on hundreds of millions of
    observations to predict future values of the enhanced vegetation
    index. We compared the predictive power of different sets of
    variables (MODIS surface reflectance data and Level-3 MODIS
    products) in two regions with distinct agro-ecological systems,
    climates, and cloud coverage: Sri Lanka and California. Performance
    in California is higher because of more cloud-free days and less
    missing data. In both regions, the correlation between the actual
    and model predicted vegetation health values in agricultural areas
    is above 0.75. Predictive power more than doubles in agricultural
    areas compared to a baseline model."

- abstract: When the United States withdrew from the Paris Climate
    Agreement, 100 private corporations reaffirmed their commitment to
    fighting climate change. While governments are often tasked with
    facing climate change, many major private institutions are taking
    steps to significantly reduce carbon emissions, reaping the benefits
    of favorable public image and reduced operational costs from energy
    and other savings. On September 5, 2018, ELI held an expert panel
    discussing the role of private institutions in climate change
    mitigation, the incentives for private actors pursuing carbon
    reduction initiatives, key factors in successful case studies, and
    methods for developing and evaluating successful private climate
    initiatives. Below, we present a transcript of the discussion, which
    has been edited for style, clarity, and space considerations.

- abstract: Law is generally represented through text, and lawyers have
    for centuries classified large bodies of legal text into distinct
    topics --- they "topic model" the law. But large bodies of legal
    documents present challenges for conventional topic modeling
    methods. The task of gathering, reviewing, coding, sorting, and
    assessing a body of tens of thousands of legal documents is a
    daunting proposition. Recent advances in computational text
    analytics, a subset of the field of "artificial intelligence," are
    already gaining traction in legal practice settings such as
    e-discovery by leveraging the speed and capacity of computers to
    process enormous bodies of documents. Differences between
    conventional and computational methods, however, suggest that
    computational text modeling has its own limitations, but that the
    two methods used in unison could be a powerful research tool for
    legal scholars in their research as well.

- abstract: Climate change is a *global* problem. Food, water, health,
    housing, and life are basic *individual* human rights. However,
    *between* the global forces of climate change and individual
    challenges of meeting basic needs, communities are the context in
    which people experience the effects of climate change and seek to
    adapt to its impact on their livelihoods. Such adaptation may
    include permanent migration and certainly, this has been one of the
    foci of international relations and security politics related to
    climate change. Of course, such migration will have human rights
    consequences and there are human rights causes to some of this
    migration as well. Of equal importance, but gaining less attention,
    are the problems related to climate change effects that do not cause
    mass migration, that may include short-term seasonal migration, and
    that also have human rights causes and consequences. In this
    chapter, we use a study in rural Bangladesh to demonstrate the
    import of the human rights considerations of this second,
    community-level, impact of climate change on human rights. We find
    that the human rights impacts of slow and rapid onset environmental
    change are a function of democratic, social, and economic rights,
    that is, those human rights that are best understood as enjoyed
    *through* political community are equally worthy of our rights
    attention because they are essential to climate change adaptation.

- abstract: I have been fortunate to have witnessed a complete
    transformation of the nature of collaboration across disciplines
    over the course of my career. As a graduate student in Physics, I
    did my doctoral research in an interdisciplinary laser spectroscopy
    laboratory established by my adviser and two chemists. My interests
    were primarily in performing spectroscopy on small molecules
    precisely enough to test theoretical predictions of quantum
    electrodynamic effects in the hydrogen molecule, while the chemists
    used much of the same equipment to study larger molecules. The
    intellectual atmosphere of the laboratory was fascinating, and the
    daily conversations across our similar but distinct disciplines gave
    me a taste that I never lost for seeking out ways in which I can
    learn new perspectives on the problems I am working on by discussing
    them with people in different disciplines. However, despite a
    productive research effort that brought in substantial funding and
    produced a steady stream of publications in major physics and
    chemistry journals, my adviser's tenure case was hindered by the
    perception in the two departments that he was doing too much physics
    to be a chemist and too much chemistry to be a physicist. More
    broadly, the challenge of interdisciplinary research was a frequent
    topic of discussion in the American Physical Society and the
    American Chemical Society, with broad agreement that such research
    held great promise for advancing the frontiers of knowledge, but
    most senior members concluded that it was too politically risky for
    junior faculty to attempt, and should be left until after achieving
    tenure.

    arrive at a clear conclusion about what, if anything, ought to be
    done about those problems. Though he presents a handful of alarming
    anecdotes, he cannot say whether these represent the exception or
    the rule, and it makes a difference whether scientific discourse
    mostly works, with a few glaring exceptions, or is pervasively
    broken.Real life does not distinguish as clearly as Kloor attempts
    to do between scientific and ideological considerations. The article
    by Roger Pielke in *FiveThirtyEight*FiveThirtyEight, which Kloor
    discusses at length, certainly attracted ideological responses, but
    it was also widely criticized on scientific grounds. Pielke and his
    critics, such as William Nordhaus, have published arguments for and
    against in peer-reviewed journals. For those who sincerely believe
    that someone's methods are deeply flawed and his or her conclusions
    factually incorrect, it is not an act of censorship, but of
    responsible peer review or journalism to not print that work. To do
    otherwise risks contributing to the phenomenon Maxwell Boykoff and
    Jules Boykoff call "Balance as Bias."Balance as Bias.

- abstract: Private sector action provides one of the most promising
    opportunities to reduce the risks of climate change, buying time
    while governments move slowly or even oppose climate mitigation.
    Starting with the insight that much of the resistance to climate
    mitigation is grounded in concern about the role of government, this
    books draws on law, policy, social science, and climate science to
    demonstrate how private initiatives are already bypassing government
    inaction in the US and around the globe. It makes a persuasive case
    that private governance can reduce global carbon emissions by a
    billion tons per year over the next decade. Combining an examination
    of the growth of private climate initiatives over the last decade, a
    theory of why private actors are motivated to reduce emissions, and
    a review of viable next steps, this book speaks to scholars,
    business and advocacy group managers, philanthropists, policymakers,
    and anyone interested in climate change.

- abstract: Since the 1960s, $\sim 5000~\text{km}^2$ of tidal deltaplain
    in southwest Bangladesh has been embanked and converted to densely
    inhabited, agricultural islands (i.e., polders). This landscape is
    juxtaposed to the adjacent Sundarbans, a pristine mangrove forest,
    both well connected by a dense network of tidal channels that
    effectively convey water and sediment throughout the region. The
    extensive embanking in poldered areas, however, has greatly reduced
    the tidal prism (i.e., volume of water) transported through local
    channels. We reveal that $>600~\text{km}$ of these major waterways
    have infilled in recent decades, converting to land through enhanced
    sedimentation and the direct blocking of waterways by embankments
    and sluice gates. Nearly all of the observed closures ($\sim 98\%$)
    have occurred along the embanked polder systems, with no comparable
    changes occurring in channels of the Sundarbans ($<2\%$ change). We
    attribute most of the channel infilling to the local reduction of
    tidal prism in poldered areas and the associated decline in current
    velocities. The infilled channels account for $\sim 90~\text{km}^2$
    of new land in the last 40--50 years, the rate of which,
    $\sim 2~\text{km}^2/\text{yr}$, offsets the
    $4~\text{km}^2/\text{yr}$ that is eroded at the coast, and is
    equivalent to $\sim 20\%$ of the new land produced naturally at the
    Ganges-Brahmaputra tidal rivermouth. Most of this new land, called
    'khas' in Bengali, has been reclaimed for agriculture or
    aquaculture, contributing to the local economy. However, benefits
    are tempered by the loss of navigable waterways for commerce,
    transportation, and fishing, as well as the forced rerouting of
    tidal waters and sediments necessary to sustain this low-lying
    landscape against rising sea level. A more sustainable delta will
    require detailed knowledge of the consequences of these hydrodynamic
    changes to support more scientifically-grounded management of water,
    sediment, and tidal energy distribution.

- abstract: National drinking water assessments for Bangladesh do not
    reflect local variability, or temporal differences. This paper
    reports on the findings of an interdisciplinary investigation of
    drinking water insecurity in a rural coastal south-western
    Bangladesh. Drinking water quality is assessed by comparison of
    locally measured concentrations to national levels and water quality
    criteria; resident's access to potable water and their perceptions
    are based on local social surveys. Residents in the study area use
    groundwater far less than the national average; salinity and local
    rainwater scarcity necessitates the use of multiple water sources
    throughout the year. Groundwater concentrations of arsenic and
    specific conductivity (SpC) were greater than surface water (pond)
    concentrations; there was no statistically significant seasonal
    difference in mean concentrations in groundwater, but there was for
    ponds, with arsenic higher in the dry season. Average arsenic
    concentrations in local water drinking were 2--4 times times the
    national average. All of the local groundwater samples exceeded the
    Bangladesh guidance for SpC, although the majority of residents
    surveyed did not perceive their water as having a "bad" or "salty"
    taste.

- abstract: "Drought and water scarcity are growing challenges to
    agriculture around the world. Farmers can adapt through both
    individual and community-based collective actions. We draw on
    extensive field-work conducted with paddy farmers in rural Sri Lanka
    to study adaptations to water scarcity, including switching to less
    water-intensive crops, farming collectively on shared land, and
    individually turning to groundwater by digging wells. We explore how
    variability in climate affects agricultural decision-making at the
    community and individual levels using three types of
    decision-making, each characterized by an objective function:
    risk-averse expected utility, regret-adjusted expected utility, and
    prospect theory loss-aversion. We also assess how the introduction
    of individualized access to irrigation water with wells affects
    community-based drought mitigation practices. Preliminary results
    suggest that the growth of well-irrigation may produce sudden
    disruptions to community-based adaptations, but that this depends on
    the mental models farmers use to think about risk and make decisions
    under uncertainty."

  title: Dynamics of individual and collective agricultural adaptation

  type: paper-conference

- abstract: Droughts affect more people than any other natural disaster.
    Drought severity is not merely a function of precipitation; it
    emerges from a web of interrelations between human and natural
    systems. The impacts of drought are equally complex, shifting across
    temporal scales, economic sectors, and regions. Even in regions with
    similar hydroclimatic characteristics, there is tremendous variation
    in the effects of drought. This study combines satellite imagery,
    geospatial data, and qualitative data to identify the multi-scalar
    factors that drive variations in agricultural responses to drought.
    We analyzed eleven years of remotely sensed imagery to identify
    agricultural areas in which cultivation occurred during an extreme
    drought in Sri Lanka. We visited a subset of these communities and
    conducted interviews with officials and farmers to identify the
    factors that influenced agricultural adaptation. Results suggest
    that though structural factors such as infrastructural capacity and
    physical environment significantly affect agricultural adaptation,
    dynamic factors such as local control of water supply, perceived
    risk, community cohesion, and farmer experience explain significant
    variation in the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems.

- abstract: This project applies machine learning techniques to remotely
    sensed imagery to train and validate predictive models of vegetation
    health in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. For both locations, we
    downloaded and processed eleven years of imagery from multiple MODIS
    datasets which were combined and transformed into two-dimensional
    matrices. We applied a gradient boosted machines model to the lagged
    dataset values to forecast future values of the Enhanced Vegetation
    Index (EVI). The predictive power of raw spectral data MODIS
    products were compared across time periods and land use categories.
    Our models have significantly more predictive power on held-out
    datasets than a baseline. Though the tool was built to increase
    capacity to monitor vegetation health in data scarce regions like
    South Asia, users may include ancillary spatiotemporal datasets
    relevant to their region of interest to increase predictive power
    and to facilitate interpretation of model results. The tool can
    automatically update predictions as new MODIS data is made available
    by NASA. The tool is particularly well-suited for decision makers
    interested in understanding and predicting vegetation health
    dynamics in countries in which environmental data is scarce and
    cloud cover is a significant concern.

- abstract: A spatiotemporal analysis of two well-known agricultural
    drought indices, the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and the
    Standardized Precipitation Index at a 9-month scale (SPI-9), is
    presented for Sri Lanka. The analysis was conducted based on monthly
    precipitation and temperature data from January 1881 to December
    2010 using 13 stations distributed across the three climatic zones
    of the country. Principal component analysis shows that the first
    two principal components of PDSI and SPI-9 are spatially comparable
    and could physically represent the two main monsoons. A wavelet
    analysis of these principal components' scores for both indices
    indicates a stronger association between the Northeastern monsoon
    and El-Niño in recent decades. Correlation analysis with
    agricultural metrics suggests that different indices might be
    appropriate for each of the climatic zones in Sri Lanka. PDSI
    correlated best with the intermediate zone districts; SPI-9
    correlated best with the dry zone districts; but neither index
    correlated well with the wet zone districts.

- abstract: Although there are multiple causes of the water scarcity
    crisis in the American Southwest, it can be used as a model of the
    long-term problem of freshwater shortages that climate change will
    exacerbate. We examine the water-supply crisis for 22 cities in the
    extended Southwest of the United States and develop a unique, new
    measure of water conservation policies and programs. Convergent
    qualitative and quantitative analyses suggest that political
    conflicts play an important role in the transition of water-supply
    regimes toward higher levels of demandreduction policies and
    programs. Qualitative analysis using institutional theory identifies
    the interaction of four types of motivating logics---development,
    rural preservation, environmental, and urban consumer---and shows
    how demand-reduction strategies can potentially satisfy all four.
    Quantitative analysis of the explanatory factors for the variation
    in the adoption of demand-reduction policies points to the
    overwhelming importance of political preferences as defined by
    Cook's Partisan Voting Index. We suggest that approaches to
    water-supply choices are influenced less by direct partisan
    disagreements than by broad preferences for a development logic
    based on supplyincrease strategies and discomfort with
    demand-reduction strategies that clash with conservative beliefs.

- abstract: Despite much scientific evidence, a large fraction of the
    American public doubts that greenhouse gases are causing global
    warming. We present a simulation model as a computational test-bed
    for climate prediction markets. Traders adapt their beliefs about
    future temperatures based on the profits of other traders in their
    social network. We simulate two alternative climate futures, in
    which global temperatures are primarily driven either by carbon
    dioxide or by solar irradiance. These represent, respectively, the
    scientific consensus and a hypothesis advanced by prominent
    skeptics. We conduct sensitivity analyses to determine how a variety
    of factors describing both the market and the physical climate may
    affect traders' beliefs about the cause of global climate change.
    Market participation causes most traders to converge quickly toward
    believing the \"true\" climate model, suggesting that a climate
    market could be useful for building public consensus.

- abstract: Between the national and household factors, community or
    "meso-level" changes in political economy and livelihoods in
    southwestern Bangladesh illustrate that in order to understand the
    impacts on people and nations of climate change-related
    environmental changes---changes that are expected to include rising
    sea level, saline inundation, and increased likelihood and intensity
    of cyclones in Bangladesh---we need to understand the dynamics of
    the built and natural environment and the political economies these
    sustain. Meso-level political economies affect the sources of income
    and livelihood available in distressed environmental conditions, and
    therefore influence how well the people in them can adapt to
    changing environmental conditions. In this study we have seen the
    underlying political economies whose dynamics, and not slow onset
    environmental changes or disastrous environmental events, are
    pushing Bangladeshis to incorporate migration strategies into their
    livelihood strategies.

- abstract: The Ganges-Brahmaputra river delta, with 170 million people
    and a vast, low-lying coastal plain, is perceived to be at great
    risk of increased flooding and submergence from sea-level rise.
    However, human alteration of the landscape can create similar risks
    to sea-level rise. Here, we report that islands in southwest
    Bangladesh, enclosed by embankments in the 1960s, have lost
    1.0--1.5m of elevation, whereas the neighbouring Sundarban mangrove
    forest has remained comparatively stable. We attribute this
    elevation loss to interruption of sedimentation inside the
    embankments, combined with accelerated compaction, removal of forest
    biomass, and a regionally increased tidal range. One major
    consequence of this elevation loss occurred in 2009 when the
    embankments of several large islands failed during Cyclone Aila,
    leaving large areas of land tidally inundated for up to two years
    until embankments were repaired. Despite sustained human suering
    during this time, the newly reconnected landscape received tens of
    centimetres of tidally deposited sediment, equivalent to decades'
    worth of normal sedimentation. Although many areas still lie well
    below mean high water and remain at risk of severe flooding, we
    conclude that elevation recovery may be possible through controlled
    embankment breaches.

- abstract: Flood-control measures, such as levees and floodwalls, can
    backfire and increase risks of disastrous floods by giving the
    public a false sense of security and thus encouraging people to
    build valuable property in high-risk locations. More generally,
    nonlinear interactions between human land-use and natural processes
    can produce unexpected emergent phenomena in coupled human-natural
    systems (CHNS). We describe a participatory agent-based simulation
    of coupled urban development and flood risks and discuss the
    potential of this simulation to help educate a wide range of the
    public---from middle- and high-school students to public
    officials---about emergence in CHNS and present results from two
    pilot studies.

- abstract: Cities across the world have had to diversify and expand
    their water supply systems in response to demand growth, groundwater
    depletion and pollution, and instability and inadequacy of regional
    surface freshwater sources. In the U.S., these problems plague not
    only the arid Western cities but increasingly also cities in the
    Eastern portions of the country. Although cities continue to seek
    out new sources of water via Promethean projects of long-distance
    supply systems, desalinization plants, and the recharge of aquifers
    with surface water, they also pursue water conservation because of
    its low cost and other benefits. We examine water conservation as a
    complex sociotechnical system comprising interactions of political,
    sociodemographic, economic, and hydroclimatological factors. We
    provide quantitative data on the factors that affect more and less
    advanced transitions in water conservation regimes, and we show that
    water stress and other hydrological data can only partially predict
    the transition. We also provide qualitative case studies to identify
    institutional and political barriers to more advanced water
    conservation regimes. This interdisciplinary, mixed methods approach
    typifies the need for knowledge that informs hydrologists about how
    their research may or may not be adopted by decision-makers.

- abstract: This article outlines a method for automatically generating
    models of dynamic decision-making that both have strong predictive
    power and are interpretable in human terms. This is useful for
    designing empirically grounded agent-based simulations and for
    gaining direct insight into observed dynamic processes. We use an
    efficient model representation and a genetic algorithm-based
    estimation process to generate simple approximations that explain
    most of the structure of complex stochastic processes. This method,
    implemented in C^++^ and R, scales well to large data sets. We apply
    our methods to empirical data from human subjects game experiments
    and international relations. We also demonstrate the method's
    ability to recover known data-generating processes by simulating
    data with agent-based models and correctly deriving the underlying
    decision models for multiple agent models and degrees of
    stochasticity.

- abstract: This Article examines how private governance can bypass
    government gridlock on climate change and buy time for a national
    and international carbon price. A carbon price---whether in the form
    of a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade program---is the optimal
    government response but is unlikely to be implemented within the
    next decade. Likely government policies will reduce emissions by far
    less than needed to reduce the risk of significant climate
    disruption, but recent corporate carbon disclosure programs, supply
    chain contracting requirements, investor pressure, and other private
    initiatives demonstrate the viability of another approach. Private
    initiatives can reduce carbon emissions without the coercive power
    or resources of government by correcting market and behavioral
    failures and by drawing on the support for mitigation that exists in
    a subset of the population. The Article demonstrates how a private
    governance wedge of emissions reductions can be achieved by
    expanding current corporate and household private governance
    initiatives and by launching new initiatives that address climate
    beliefs, motivations, and behavior. Private initiatives can bypass
    ideological barriers and national boundaries, but implementing a
    private climate governance strategy will require relaxing the
    assumption that only governments can drive major emissions
    reductions over the next decade.

    instruments. Law and policy debates typically evaluate policy
    instruments by their expected performance after adoption, tacitly
    excluding consideration of the timing of adoption. Under this
    standard, a comprehensive carbon pricing instrument, either in the
    form of a cap and trade program or a carbon tax, has emerged as the
    preferred approach. Yet by excluding the political process from
    consideration, this standard obscures the effects of political
    feasibility on the timing of adoption. For many problems, the
    advantages of an optimal policy outweigh the advantages of a
    sub-optimal one that will require less time and effort to adopt. The
    climate problem is different: the irreversibility of climate change,
    the possibility of tipping points in the climate system, and lag
    times in infrastructure investments combine to impose large costs on
    delay. Excluding political opportunity costs from instrument
    evaluation leads to a preference for slow, comprehensive remedies.
    The casualties in this process are incremental instruments that
    could buy time, facilitate the adoption of additional instruments,
    and complement those instruments after they are adopted. This Essay
    proposes explicit consideration of political opportunity costs in
    evaluating climate policy instruments and applies this approach to
    several leading climate policies."

- abstract: "Much of energy policy is driven by concerns about climate
    change. Views about the importance of carbon emissions affect
    debates on topics ranging from the regulation of electricity
    generation and transmission to the need for incentives to develop
    and promote emerging technologies. Government efforts to fund and
    communicate climate science have been extraordinary, but recent
    polling suggests that roughly half of the American population is
    unsure or does not believe that anthropogenic climate change is
    occurring. Among some populations belief in climate change is
    declining even as the climate science becomes more certain. Much of
    the doubt occurs among individuals who support free markets, and the
    doubt is fueled by the argument that governments and
    government-funded climate scientists are not accounting for
    information that is inconsistent with the climate consensus. This
    Article explores a private governance response: the creation of a
    prediction market to assess and communicate the implications of
    climate science. Markets not only allow the buying and selling of
    goods, they provide information about the likelihood of future
    events. Research suggests that markets are often able to account for
    information that is outside of the conventional wisdom. In addition,
    individuals who are likely to doubt climate science may find markets
    to be credible sources of information. A climate market could take
    the form of an academic initiative along the lines of the Iowa
    presidential prediction market or could operate as a more
    traditional options market. Trading could occur over the types of
    predictions that matter for global climate change, such as the
    global average temperature or sea level in 2020 or 2100, with the
    current market value of the prediction signaling the likelihood of
    the outcome. The market will be subject to manipulation concerns,
    but experience with other prediction markets suggests that a climate
    prediction market has the potential to provide an accurate, credible
    and widely-disseminated signal about the status of the climate
    science."

- abstract: "Environmental vulnerability in Bangladesh---especially
    vulnerability to climate change---is too often treated in isolation
    from the social, economic, and political contexts in which
    communities and their inhabitants make their livelihood. We propose
    that resilience and vulnerability to environmental stress are best
    understood in terms of a modification of Ostrom's socioecological
    systems paradigm that we call \"multiple dynamic equilibria:\"
    livelihoods in vulnerable regions are shaped by multiple overlapping
    patterns of interaction between the physical environment in which
    people live and the social, economic, and political environments in
    which they interact, within their communities, with other
    communities, and external actors. Translating policy goals into
    effective action requires understanding these interactions at
    multiple levels. We report on a new transdisciplinary project that
    draws geoscientists, engineers, and social scientists together to
    investigate the interactions between communities and the environment
    in the southwestern coastal region of Bangladesh and understand the
    dynamics of vulnerability and resilience."

- abstract: Deltas are dynamic landforms that have been the foci of
    agri- and aquacultural development by humans for millennia. The
    dynamics of deltas are governed by changes in river discharge and
    reworking of sediment. While these dynamics make deltas highly
    productive areas, they also present challenges to farming practices,
    often resulting in complicated feedbacks. These dynamics include
    river and coastal flooding, compaction, subsidence, salinization,
    and moving land-water boundaries. Likewise, farming in a dynamic
    environment can lead to socio-economic conflicts. Adaptation to
    these constantly changing variables requires flexible farming
    practices that must keep pace with changing climate.

- abstract: "The individual and household sector accounts for roughly 40
    percent of United States energy use and carbon dioxide emissions,
    yet the laws and policies directed at reductions from this sector
    often reflect a remarkably simplistic model of behavior. This Essay
    addresses one of the obstacles to achieving a \"behavioral
    wedge\"behavioral wedge of individual and household emissions
    reductions: the lack of an accessible, brief summary for
    policymakers of the key findings of behavioral and social science
    studies on household energy behavior. The Essay does not provide a
    comprehensive overview of the field, but it discusses many of the
    leading studies that demonstrate the extent and limits of rational
    action. These studies can inform lawyers and policymakers who are
    developing measures to reduce energy use and carbon emissions and
    can serve as an entry point for more detailed studies of the
    literature.An effective response to the climate change problem will
    require substantial reductions in energy demand in addition to new
    developments in low-carbon energy supplies. The individual and
    household sector presents a major opportunity: the sector accounts
    for roughly 40% of U.S. carbon emissions and a comparable percentage
    of total U.S. energy production, and it is one of the most promising
    areas for reducing emissions. A recent analysis estimates that
    behavioral measures directed at this sector could reasonably be
    expected to reduce total US emissions by over 7% by 2020, an amount
    larger than the combined emissions from several of the
    largest-emitting industrial sectors and larger than the total
    emissions of France. In many cases, these emissions reductions can
    be achieved at less cost than the leading alternatives.Despite this
    opportunity, recent regulatory and policy efforts are only beginning
    to direct substantial attention to the individual and household
    sector. Findings from the social sciences provide valuable insights
    into how to capitalize on this opportunity, yet policymakers often
    have little time to develop new polices and are confronted with a
    barrage of often-conflicting approaches and theories. This Essay
    addresses the policy-making challenge by distilling the findings
    from a broad range of fields into several key principles for those
    developing energy and climate laws and policies. The principles we
    outline here are a starting point for policymakers working in this
    area. We attempt to provide insight into which principles are most
    relevant to law and policy, but instructions as to how to
    incorporate these principles are beyond the scope of this essay. The
    principles include only a subset of the insights from the behavioral
    and social science literature. In many cases, adherence to multiple
    principles will be necessary to develop the most effective policy
    design. Policymakers should consult the body of work referenced
    here, as well as experts in the social sciences to further their
    understanding of these and other principles. More extensive reviews
    of this literature and its relevance to energy and climate policy
    are also available."

- abstract: In his book about the financial crisis that led to the
    so-called "Great Recession,"Great Recession, Michael Lewis tells the
    story of Michael Burry, a short-seller who realized that many
    subprime mortgage bonds were worthless if the inevitable
    happened---if home prices leveled off. Home prices did not need to
    actually fall for the financial meltdown to occur; they simply
    needed to level off. Models that valued subprime home loan-based
    derivatives did not reveal the extent of the risk because the models
    could not account for stable or falling home prices. Burry assumed
    that once this information became widespread, the market for these
    risky derivatives would collapse. To his surprise, even when the
    insight was widely shared, the party continued for years. By then,
    many individuals and institutions were too heavily invested in not
    seeing that the emperor had no clothes to change course before the
    meltdown began.We had a reaction similar to Burry's the first time
    we read one of Harvard economist Martin Weitzman's articles on the
    failure to include fat tailed risks in the leading integrated
    assessment models (IAMs) of climate change costs and benefits. The
    aspect of climate change most worthy of substantial attention by
    anyone interested in rational risk regulation is the existence of
    catastrophic, irreversible outcomes. Small shifts in rainfall or
    temperature may or may not be worthy of regulatory expenditures, but
    they do not pose core, long-term threats. Peer-reviewed publications
    by paleoclimatologists and climate scientists suggest, however, that
    there are disturbingly high likelihoods of temperature increases and
    sea level rises that could cause the kinds of systemic failures that
    almost brought down the financial system in 2008.

- abstract: As I discuss the ethics that apply over enormous spans of
    time, I will not seek to find a universal rational principle to
    dictate our obligations to distant future generations. I will take
    my starting point from David Hume, who noted that ethics requires a
    combination of empirical and theoretical work. The ends we seek are
    to be found in empirical observation of our moral sentiments and a
    rational account of the circumstances in which these sentiments
    blossom and produce fruit.To someone who has no moral feeling for
    the distant future, my account will not change his or her mind, but
    I hope that my ruminations can clarify what we argue about when we
    dispute the existence or the nature of such obligations. Thus, I
    take as my starting point my personal sense that distant generations
    matter, ask whether this sentiment is widely shared, and then,
    having seated it in a broader tradition, study different
    perspectives on the nature of this affinity, asking which are more
    or less useful to understanding it clearly.

- abstract: The goal, articulated by President Obama in 2009, of
    reducing U.S. carbon emissions 17% from the 2005 level by 2020 is
    eminently achievable without new technology or appreciable sacrifice
    by energy users. However, achieving it will in part require
    sophisticated energy efficiency and conservation programs. To
    overcome institutional and behavioral barriers, these programs will
    need to implement six principles of effective design derived from 30
    years of behavioral and social science research. We focus on the
    household sector, but believe our general conclusions likely apply
    to other sectors as well.

- abstract: The time is ripe to identify additional politically viable,
    low-cost, nonintrusive strategies to reduce carbon emissions. This
    article examines how laws and policies can reduce U.S. carbon
    emissions by 7% or more by inducing changes in household technology
    adoption and use. This "behavioral wedge" of emissions reductions
    will buy time for a stronger public consensus to emerge on the need
    for more intrusive carbon mitigation measures (e.g., regulating
    emissions, pricing carbon) and will complement the additional
    measures after they are adopted. The article identifies six
    principles for the design of behavioral wedge policies and programs
    and uses the design principles to evaluate recent federal household
    energy initiatives.

- abstract: Despite the large contribution of individuals and households
    to climate change, little has been done in the US to reduce the
    $\mathrm{CO}_2$ emissions attributable to this sector. Motor vehicle
    idling among individual private citizens is one behavior that may be
    amenable to large-scale policy interventions. Currently, little data
    are available to quantify the potential reductions in emissions that
    could be realized by successful policy interventions. In addition,
    little is known about the motivations and beliefs that underlie
    idling. In the fall of 2007, 1300 drivers in the US were surveyed to
    assess typical idling practices, beliefs and motivations. Results
    indicate that the average individual idled for over 16 min a day and
    believed that a vehicle can be idled for at least 3.6 min before it
    is better to turn it off. Those who held inaccurate beliefs idled,
    on average, over 1 min longer than the remainder of the sample.
    These data suggest that idling accounts for over 93 MMt of
    $\mathrm{CO}_2$ and 10.6 billion gallons (40.1 billion liters) of
    gasoline a year, equaling 1.6% of all US emissions. Much of this
    idling is unnecessary and economically disadvantageous to drivers.
    The policy implications of these findings are discussed.

- abstract: Most climate change policy attention has been addressed to
    long-term options, such as inducing new, low-carbon energy
    technologies and creating cap-and-trade regimes for emissions. We
    use a behavioral approach to examine the reasonably achievable
    potential for near-term reductions by altered adoption and use of
    available technologies in US homes and nonbusiness travel. We
    estimate the plasticity of 17 household action types in 5
    behaviorally distinct categories by use of data on the most
    effective documented interventions that do not involve new
    regulatory measures. These interventions vary by type of action and
    typically combine several policy tools and strong social marketing.
    National implementation could save an estimated 123 million metric
    tons of carbon per year in year 10, which is 20% of household direct
    emissions or 7.4% of US national emissions, with little or no
    reduction in household well-being. The potential of household action
    deserves increased policy attention. Future analyses of this
    potential should incorporate behavioral as well as economic and
    engineering elements.

- abstract: Fluorescence imaging has become a common modality in cardiac
    electrodynamics. A single fluorescent parameter is typically
    measured. Given the growing emphasis on simultaneous imaging of more
    than one cardiac variable, we present an analysis of the potential
    of dual camera imaging, using as an example our straightforward dual
    camera system that allows simultaneous measurement of two dynamic
    quantities from the same region of the heart. The advantages of our
    system over others include an optional software camera calibration
    routine that eliminates the need for precise camera alignment. The
    system allows for rapid setup, dichroic image separation, dual-rate
    imaging, and high spatial resolution, and it is generally applicable
    to any two-camera measurement. This type of imaging system offers
    the potential for recording simultaneously not only transmembrane
    potential and intracellular calcium, two frequently measured
    quantities, but also other signals more directly related to
    myocardial metabolism, such as \[K+\]e, NADH, and reactive oxygen
    species, leading to the possibility of correlative multimodal
    cardiac imaging. We provide a compilation of dye and camera
    information critical to the design of dual camera systems and
    experiments.

- abstract: "The individual and household sector generates roughly 30 to
    40 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and is a potential
    source of prompt and large emissions reductions. Yet the assumption
    that only extensive government regulation will generate substantial
    reductions from the sector is a barrier to change, particularly in a
    political environment hostile to regulation. This Article
    demonstrates that prompt and large reductions can be achieved
    without relying predominantly on regulatory measures. The Article
    identifies seven \"low-hanging fruit:\" actions that have the
    potential to achieve large reductions at less than half the cost of
    the leading current federal legislation, require limited up-front
    government expenditures, generate net savings for the individual,
    and do not confront other barriers. The seven actions discussed in
    this Article not only meet these criteria, but also will generate
    roughly 150 million tons in emissions reductions and several billion
    dollars in net social savings. The Article concludes that the
    actions identified here are only a beginning, and it identifies
    changes that will be necessary by policymakers and academicians if
    these and other low-hanging fruit are to be picked."

    still not fully understood and are the subject of ongoing research.
    Clinical defibrillators do not provide the precise control of shock
    timing, duration, and voltage or other features needed for detailed
    scientific inquiry, and there are few, if any, commercially
    available units designed for research applications. For this reason,
    we have developed a high-voltage, programmable, capacitive-discharge
    stimulator optimized to deliver defibrillation shocks with precise
    timing and voltage control to an isolated animal heart, either in
    air or in a bath. This stimulator is capable of delivering voltages
    of up to 500V and energies of nearly 100J with timing accuracy of a
    few microseconds and with rise and fall times of 5$\mu$s or less and
    is controlled only by two external timing pulses and a control
    computer that sets the stimulation parameters via a LABVIEW
    interface. Most importantly, the stimulator has circuits to protect
    the high-voltage circuitry and the operator from programming and
    input-output errors. This device has been tested and used
    successfully in field shock experiments on rabbit hearts as well as
    other protocols requiring high voltage.

- abstract: Risk assessment is one tool of legal and policy
    decision-making, and one that may play a large role in establishing
    nanotechnology policy and regulations. In this Article, Jonathan
    Gilligan analyzes different methods of risk assessment and applies
    these methods to nanotechnology. Gilligan challenges the notion that
    people perceive and react to risk in a logical way, postulating that
    both experts and laypeople are susceptible to irrationality when it
    comes to risk perception. He concludes with a determination that a
    singular approach to risk management of nanotechnology may not be
    enough; rather, multiple risk management methods should be utilized
    depending on qualitative assessments of different nanotechnologies.

- abstract: Light scattering is used to monitor the dynamics and energy
    thresholds of laser-induced structural alterations in biopolymers
    due to irradiation by a free electron laser (FEL) in the
    infrared (IR) wavelength range 2.2 to 8.5 $\mu$m. Attenuated total
    reflectance (ATR) Fourier-transform IR (FTIR) spectroscopy is used
    to examine infrared tissue absorption spectra before and after
    irradiation. Light scattering by bovine and porcine cartilage and
    cornea samples is measured in real time during FEL irradiation using
    a 650-nm diode laser and a diode photoarray with time resolution of
    10 ms. The data on the time dependence of light scattering in the
    tissue are modeled to estimate the approximate values of kinetic
    parameters for denaturation as functions of laser wavelength and
    radiant exposure. We found that the denaturation threshold is
    slightly lower for cornea than for cartilage, and both depend on
    laser wavelength. An inverse correlation between denaturation
    thresholds and the absorption spectrum of the tissue is observed for
    many wavelengths; however, for wavelengths near 3 and 6 $\mu$m, the
    denaturation threshold does not exhibit the inverse correlation,
    instead being governed by heating kinetics of tissue. It is shown
    that light scattering is useful for measuring the denaturation
    thresholds and dynamics for different biotissues, except where the
    initial absorptivity is very high.

- abstract: Hydrogen chemistry in thin films and biological systems is
    one of the most difficult experimental problems in today's science
    and technology. We successfully tested a novel solution, based on
    the spectroscopic version of scanning near-field optical
    microscopy (SNOM). The tunable infrared radiation of the Vanderbilt
    free-electron laser enabled us to reveal clearly hydrogen-decorated
    grain boundaries on nominally hydrogen-free diamond films. The
    images were obtained by SNOM detection of reflected 3.5 micron
    photons, corresponding to the C-H stretch absorption, and reached a
    lateral resolution of 0.2 micron, well below the $\lambda/2$
    ($\lambda$ = wavelength) limit of classical microscopy.

However, achieving maximal emissions reductions would require frictionless supply and demand responses to the laws' incentives, and implementation that avoids polarization and efforts to repeal or undercut them. In this Perspective we discuss some of these supply, demand, and polarization challenges. We highlight insights from social science research, and identify open questions needing answers, regarding how to address these challenges. The stakes are high: these new laws' successes could catalyze virtuous cycles in the energy transition, or their failures could breed cynicism about major government spending on climate change.},

Modeling estimates from Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit (REPEAT) suggest that the IRA's \$331 billion investment can reduce carbon emissions by as much as 4\% below a 2005 baseline by 2030, assuming a low-friction economic environment. To evaluate the role of household actions, we use a two-part method: 1) Policy analyses of the IRA and IIJA to
identify household incentives; 2) Secondary data analysis of REPEAT's policy models to identify the potential for emissions reductions associated with household action. We find that \$39 billion, or 12\% of climate and energy funds in the IRA and \$4.3 billion or 5.7\% of clean energy and power funds in the IIJA, target voluntary household actions, and that these actions contribute 40\% of the cumulative emissions reductions under the IRA and IIJA, assuming a mid-range scenario for uptake. The importance of household actions to achieving IRA and IIJA's emissions reduction goals suggests that actual impacts will likely vary by behavioral plasticity, and that program design should reflect social and behavioral science insights.},

Sediment transported by the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers has the potential to raise the land and offset SLR. There is significant uncertainty in future sediment supply and SLR, which raises questions about the sustainability of the delta. We present a simple model, driven by basic physics, to estimate the evolution of the landscape under different conditions at low computational cost. Using a single tuning parameter, the model can match observed rates of land aggradation. We find a strong negative feedback, which robustly brings land elevation into equilibrium with changing sea level.

Although there are many such indices, we still lack an index to measure connections and cohesion within a community---the social fabric (as we refer to it) that connects its members with each other and with the place. We propose an indicator-based index social fabric index (SoFI) to both measure and map the spatial dimension of the social fabric within and across communities. We investigate approaches to constructing social fabric indices and conduct uncertainty and sensitivity analyses for each stage of constructing the underlying model of the social fabric, which includes indicator transformation, normalization, principal component selection and rotation, and weighting. From this effort, we find that the precision of the index increases with social fabric levels, corresponding to lower social vulnerability. Global sensitivity analysis shows that the coordinate transformation and PCA selection play especially important roles in determining total uncertainty. Furthermore, the preceding step tends to absorb the uncertainty contributions of the following steps through construction interactions. Finally, we consider the importance of the emotional and psychological effects of the social fabric concept and provide suggestions for future work so that we will be able to develop a more transparent, comprehensive, and robust social fabric index model.},

strengthening monsoon precipitation in the 21st century could increase this sediment delivery
34--60\%; yet other studies demonstrate that sediment could decline 15--80\% if planned dams
and river diversions are fully implemented. We validate these modeled ranges by developing a
comprehensive field-based sediment budget that quantifies the supply of Ganges-Brahmaputra
river sediment under varying Holocene climate conditions. Our data reveal natural responses in
sediment supply comparable to previously modeled results and suggest that increased
sediment delivery may be capable of offsetting accelerated sea-level rise. This prospect for a
naturally sustained Ganges-Brahmaputra delta presents possibilities beyond the dystopian
future often posed for this system, but the implementation of currently proposed dams and
diversions would preclude such opportunities.},

Analyses of water resources have been conducted using a variety of techniques, including qualitative evaluations of media narratives. This study aims to augment these methods by leveraging computational and quantitative techniques from the social sciences focused on text analyses. Specifically, we use natural language processing methods to investigate a large corpus (approx. 1.8M) of newspaper articles spanning approximately 35 years (1982--2017) for insights into human-nature interactions with water. Focusing on local and regional United States publications, our analysis demonstrates important dynamics in water-related dialogue about drinking water and pollution to other critical infrastructures, such as energy, across different parts of the country. Our assessment, which looks at water as a system, also highlights key actors and sentiments surrounding water. Extending these analytical methods could help us further improve our understanding of the complex roles of water in current society that should be considered in emerging activities to mitigate and respond to resource conflicts and climate change.},

  abstract     = {As researchers collect large amounts of data in the social sciences through household surveys,
              challenges may arise in how best to analyze such datasets, especially where motivating theories
              are unclear or conflicting. New analytical methods may be necessary to extract information from
              these datasets. Machine learning techniques are promising methods for identifying patterns in
              large datasets, but have not yet been widely used to identify important variables in social surveys
              with many questions. To demonstrate the potential of machine learning to analyze large social datasets,
              we apply machine learning techniques to the study of migration in Bangladesh. The complexity of
              migration decisions makes them suitable for analysis with machine learning techniques, which enable
              pattern identification in large datasets with many covariates. In this paper, we apply random forest
              methods to analyzing a large survey which captures approximately 2000 variables from approximately
              1700 households in southwestern Bangladesh. Our analysis ranked the covariates in the dataset in terms
              of their predictive power for migration decisions. The results identified the most important covariates,
              but there exists a tradeoff between predictive ability and interpretability. To address this tradeoff,
              random forests and other machine learning algorithms may be especially useful in combination with more
              traditional regression methods. To develop insights into how the important variables identified by the
              random forest algorithm impact migration, we performed a survival analysis of household time to first
              migration. With this combined analysis, we found that variables related to wealth and household composition
              are important predictors of migration. Such multi-methods approaches may help to shed light on factors

    a combination of economic, social, political, and environmental pressures.
    Household survey instruments can capture detailed information about
    migration histories and their contexts, but it can be challenging to
    identify important predictors from large numbers of covariates with
    standard statistical methods, such as regression analyses. Machine learning
    techniques are well suited to pattern identification and can identify
    important covariates from large datasets. We report on the application of
    machine learning approaches to two large surveys collected from a total of
    more than 2800 households in southwestern Bangladesh. We applied random
    forest classification and regression models to identify significant
    covariates with the greatest predictive power for household migration
    decisions. The results show that random forest models are able to identify
    nuances in predictors of different types of migration and migration in
    different communities. Random forests also outperform logistic regression
    and support vector machines in predicting migration in all cases analyzed.
    Therefore, random forest models and other machine learning methods can be
    useful for improving the predictive accuracy of migration models and
    identifying patterns in complex social datasets. Future work should

We develop a coupled human-natural system model for Cape Town, South Africa, which consists of an agent-based model and a regional hydrologic model, to study the FEW nexus connecting the agricultural, urban, and hydroelectric generation sectors. We use the model to compare three policies---a simple adaptive approach, adaptation with free water to indigent households, and water supply augmentation---and assess their ability to provide reliable FEW services to the different stakeholders under four different climate scenarios, representing moderate to severe amounts of warming. Our results indicate that Cape Town is likely to face increasing water stress as temperatures rise, and that adaptation strategies could effectively mitigate the effects of water limitations and avoid severe failures in providing FEW services across sectors. One way to manage demand for FEW services is by adjusting water price tariffs, but high prices create inequality in access to water for households with different incomes. Our analysis suggests that the water supply system in Cape Town may already be at, if not over, its sustainable capacity within the FEW nexus. Our model serves as a test-bed for assessing policies to manage stresses on water resources for the benefit of stakeholders across FEW sectors. This model can be adapted to cities and regions around the globe.},

    interdisciplinary research is crucial to understanding and effectively managing them.
    Despite support and encouragement from funding agencies, universities, and journals and
    growing interest from researchers, interdisciplinary disaster research teams face
    significant obstacles, such as the difficulty of establishing effective communication
    and understanding across disciplines.
    Better understanding of interdisciplinary teamwork can also have important practical benefits
    for operational disaster planning and response.

    Social studies of science distinguishes different kinds of expertise and different modes of communication.
    Understanding these differences
    can help interdisciplinary research teams communicate more clearly and work together more effectively.
    The primary role of a researcher is in \emph{contributory expertise\/} (the ability to make original contributions to a discipline);
    but \emph{interactional expertise\/}
    in other disciplines (the ability to understand their literature and communicate with their practitioners)
    can play an important role in interdisciplinary collaborations.
    Developing interactional
    expertise requires considerable time and effort, which can be challenging for a busy researcher,
    and also requires a foundation of trust and communication among team members.
    Three distinct aspects of communication play important roles in effective interdisciplinary
    communication:

  abstract     = {Public transit agencies struggle to maintain transit accessibility with reduced resources, unreliable ridership data, reduced vehicle capacities due to social distancing, and reduced services due to driver unavailability. In collaboration with transit agencies from two large metropolitan areas in the USA, we are designing novel approaches for addressing the afore-mentioned challenges by collecting accurate real-time ridership data, providing guidance to commuters, and performing operational optimization for public transit. We estimate rider-ship data using historical automated passenger counting data, conditional on a set of relevant determinants. Accurate ridership forecasting is essential to optimize the public transit schedule, which is necessary to improve current fixed lines with on-demand transit. Also, passenger crowding has been a problem for public transportation since it deteriorates passengers' wellbeing and satisfaction. During the COVID-19 pandemic, passenger crowding has gained importance since it represents a risk for social distancing violations. Therefore, we are creating optimization models to ensure that social distancing norms can be adequately followed while ensuring that the total demand for transit is met. We will then use accurate forecasts for operational optimization that includes (a) proactive fixed-line schedule optimization based on predicted demand, (b) dispatch of on-demand micro-transit, prioritizing at-risk populations, and (c) allocation of vehicles to transit and cargo trips, considering exigent vehicle maintenance requirements (i.e., disinfection). Finally, this paper presents some initial results from our project regarding the estimation of ridership in public transit.},

Yet, the link between environmental stress and marriage has received limited attention. Using survey data from 615 Bangladeshi households, we examine the relationship between extreme weather in the form of heat waves and dry spells, and the risk of marriage over the period from 1989 to 2013. We find that girls and women are at an increased risk of marrying in the year of or following heat waves. The link is strongest for women aged 18 to 23, and weakest for those 11 to 14. We also explore the hypothesis that extreme weather leads families to accept less desirable marriage proposals for daughters. We find that those who wed during periods of extreme heat married into poorer households and to husbands with less education. Similarly, those who married during abnormally dry periods married men man with less education and who were more supportive of intimate partner violence. Together these results suggest that, when Bangladeshi families face environmental shocks, they cope by hastening the marriage of daughters or accepting less desirable marriage proposals. Such practices are likely to have long-term impacts on the health and well-being of women and children, and underscore the unique vulnerabilities faced by women as climate change intensifies.},

Socio-environmental systems (SES) modeling integrates knowledge and perspectives into conceptual and computational tools that explicitly recognize how human decisions affect the environment. Depending on the modeling purpose, many SES modelers also realize that involvement of stakeholders and experts is fundamental to support social learning and decision-making processes for achieving improved environmental and social outcomes. The contribution of this paper lies in identifying and formulating grand challenges that need to be overcome to accelerate the development and adaptation of SES modeling. Eight challenges are delineated: bridging epistemologies across disciplines; multi-dimensional uncertainty assessment and management; scales and scaling issues; combining qualitative and quantitative methods and data; furthering the adoption and impacts of SES modeling on policy; capturing structural changes; representing human dimensions in SES; and leveraging new data types and sources. These challenges limit our ability to effectively use SES modeling to provide the knowledge and information essential for supporting decision making. Whereas some of these challenges are not unique to SES modeling and may be pervasive in other scientific fields, they still act as barriers as well as research opportunities for the SES modeling community. For each challenge, we outline basic steps that can be taken to surmount the underpinning barriers. Thus, the paper identifies priority research areas in SES modeling, chiefly related to progressing modeling products, processes and practices.},

It appears unlikely that private governance alone can reduce emissions enough to stabilize the climate, but it does have the potential to reduce emissions sufficiently and quickly enough to buy time for enacting more comprehensive public governance measures. In this Perspective, we review what is known about private governance, present a framework for analyzing private governance initiatives, outline the prospects of the framework for understanding and guiding private governance, and identify future research priorities for applying this framework.},

It concludes that the wicked problem concept is best viewed as a rhetorical device that served a valuable function in arguing against technocratic hubris in the early 1970s but is unhelpful and possibly counterproductive as a tool for modern climate policy analysis. Richard Lazarus improved on this analysis by emphasizing the urgency of a climate response in his characterization of the climate problem as ``super wicked.'' We suggest another approach based on Charles Lindblom's ``science of muddling through.'' The muddling through approach supports the rhetorical points for which the original wicked problem concept was introduced and provides greater practical guidance for developing new laws and policies to address climate change and other complex and messy environmental problems.},

The scale and scope of transformational change required across sectors and actors in society raises critical questions of feasibility. Much of the literature on mitigation pathways addresses technological and economic aspects of feasibility, but overlooks the behavioral, cultural, and social factors that affect theoretical and practical mitigation pathways. We present a tripartite framework that ``unpacks'' the concept of mitigation pathways by distinguishing three factors that together determine actual mitigation: technical potential, initiative feasibility, and behavioral plasticity. The framework aims to integrate and streamline heterogeneous disciplinary research traditions toward a more comprehensive and transparent approach that will facilitate learning across disciplines and enable mitigation pathways to more fully reflect available knowledge. We offer three suggestions for integrating the tripartite framework into current research on climate change mitigation.},

Policymakers face a blizzard of information, advocacy, and policy options, and it is easy to lose sight of the forest for the trees. Many options are attractive on the surface but will not meaningfully address the problem or are unlikely to be adopted in the foreseeable future. If policymakers make the right decision when confronting three essential choices or forks in the road, though, the result will be 60\% to 70\% reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, an amount that will keep widely-adopted climate mitigation goals in reach. The three options are decarbonization of the electrical grid, electrification of the motor vehicle fleet, and electrification of buildings. International, national, and subnational officials, philanthropists, corporate executives, advocacy group leaders, and households have the ability to prioritize these three options in their regulatory, purchasing, and other actions. If they make the right choice on these three options, many other mistakes can be made without jeopardizing the chance to achieve widely-adopted emissions targets. If they make the wrong choice, few combinations of other viable options can achieve the needed reductions. In the face of a growing consensus that major, prompt emissions reductions are required, the forks in the road approach can provide policymakers with the mental framework necessary to make smart decisions and ignore the noise surrounding climate law and policy},

Since the birth of the modern regulatory state, scholars have raised concerns that the revolving door between corporations and government agencies could induce government officials to pursue corporate interests rather than the public interest. The legal and political-science literatures have identified several benefits that may arise from the revolving door, but the thrust of the scholarship to date has emphasized the potential harms. Using several data sources, we demonstrate that as the private sector has begun to play an increasing role in environmental governance in recent years, a new revolving door has emerged between environmental-advocacy groups and corporations, institutional investment firms, and private equity firms. We demonstrate that this new revolving door is surprisingly common, and we examine the implications for the future of public and private environmental governance. Although this new revolving door creates new risks, we argue that it may turn on its head the central concern about the revolving door: The movement of environmental advocates into corporate management positions may play the role of greening corporate behavior and may accelerate the development of private environmental initiatives. We focus on the movement of employees in the environmental area---a new green revolving door---but we suggest that this new revolving door also may be emerging in labor, health and safety, and other regulatory areas.},

We treat the FEW nexus connecting municipal water use by Cape Town residents, agricultural water use by vineyards, and hydroelectric generation. We compare two scenarios for responding to drought: business-as-usual (BAU), and holistic adaptive management (HAM), where BAU takes no action until the monthly supply is insufficient to meet demand, whereas HAM takes action by raising water tariffs when the reservoir storage level drops below its pre-drought monthly average. Simulation results suggest that holistic adaptive management can alleviate the impact of drought on agricultural production, hydropower generation, and the availability of water for residential consumption.},

  abstract     = {When public governance fails to address important environmental threats---such as climate change---private governance by firms, not-for-profits, individuals, and households can produce significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Private governance can take the form of either a carrot or a stick, using incentives or punishments. Shareholder activism as a form of private governance of corporations has largely been confrontational, leading most climate-related actions to fail. This Article examines the potential for private governance to take a more collaborative approach and to frame shareholder engagement with management in terms of opportunity. It also examines private governance successes at reducing household emissions and finds that these too emphasize making it attractive and convenient for households to act.},

  abstract     = {Urban water supply systems in the United States are increasingly stressed as economic and population growth confront limited water resources. Demand management, through conservation and improved efficiency, has long been promoted as a practical alternative to building Promethean energy-intensive water-supply infrastructure. Some cities are making great progress at managing their demand, but study of conservation policies has been limited and often regionally focused. We present a hierarchical Bayesian analysis of a new measure of urban water conservation policy, the Vanderbilt Water Conservation Index (VWCI), for 195 cities in 45 states in the contiguous United States. This study does not attempt to establish causal relationships, but does observe that cities in states with arid climates tend to adopt more conservation measures. Within a state, cities with more Democratic-leaning voting preferences and large and rapidly growing populations tend to adopt more conservation measures. Economic factors and climatic differences between cities do not correlate with the number of measures adopted, but they do correlate with the character of the measures, with arid cities favoring mandatory conservation actions and cities in states with lower real personal income favoring rebates for voluntary actions. Understanding relationships between environmental and societal factors and cities' support for water conservation measures can help planners and policy-makers identify obstacles and opportunities to increase the role of conservation and efficiency in making urban water supply systems sustainable.},

  insights that can enrich theories of employer and employee
  motivations for engaging in environmental behavior, as well as
  reveal new strategies for making significant progress on

  conducting a survey of 482 US adults employed full-time, we found
  that there are a wide range of types of EEBs currently offered by
  employers, and furthermore, they were more likely to be offered
  in certain industries, such as state and local governments but
  not others such as retail. These benefits were offered to 17\% of
  employees and included a vast array of strategies and approaches.
  Guided by theorizing on employer and employee motivation,
  open-ended responses suggested employers were perceived to offer
  EEBs to maximize competiveness and because of social
  responsibility concerns, and employees tended to enroll because
  they wanted to save money and time or because they cared about
  the environment. Finally, EEBs were linked to employee
  environmental behavior and morale. The findings reveal new
  information about the types of EEBs being offered, motivations
  for offering and enrolling in EEBs, and their relationship to
  employee behavior and morale. This work suggests numerous lines

The tool automates downloading and processing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data sets and training gradient-boosted machine models on hundreds of millions of observations to predict future values of the enhanced vegetation index. We compared the predictive power of different sets of variables (MODIS surface reflectance data and Level-3 MODIS products) in two regions with distinct agro-ecological systems, climates, and cloud coverage: Sri Lanka and California. Performance in California is higher because of more cloud-free days and less missing data. In both regions, the correlation between the actual and model predicted vegetation health values in agricultural areas is above 0.75. Predictive power more than doubles in agricultural areas compared to a baseline model.},

the context in which people experience the effects of climate change and seek to adapt

and certainly, this has been one of the foci of international relations and security politics
related to climate change. Of course, such migration will have human rights consequences
and there are human rights causes to some of this migration as well. Of equal importance,
but gaining less attention, are the problems related to climate change effects that do
not cause mass migration, that may include short-term seasonal migration, and that also
have human rights causes and consequences. In this chapter, we use a study in rural
Bangladesh to demonstrate the import of the human rights considerations of this second,
community-level, impact of climate change on human rights. We find that the human
rights impacts of slow and rapid onset environmental change are a function of
democratic, social, and economic rights, that is, those human rights that are best
understood as enjoyed \emph{through\/} political community are equally worthy of our
rights attention because they are essential to climate change adaptation.},

My interests were primarily in performing spectroscopy on small molecules precisely enough to test theoretical predictions of quantum electrodynamic effects in the hydrogen molecule, while the chemists used much of the same equipment to study larger molecules. The intellectual atmosphere of the laboratory was fascinating, and the daily conversations across our similar but distinct disciplines gave me a taste that I never lost for seeking out ways in which I can learn new perspectives on the problems I am working on by discussing them with people in different disciplines. However, despite a productive research effort that brought in substantial funding and produced a steady stream of publications in major physics and chemistry journals, my adviser's tenure case was hindered by the perception in the two departments that he was doing too much physics to be a chemist and too much chemistry to be a physicist. More broadly, the challenge of interdisciplinary research was a frequent topic of discussion in the American Physical Society and the American Chemical Society, with broad agreement that such research held great promise for advancing the frontiers of knowledge, but most senior members concluded that it was too politically risky for junior faculty to attempt, and should be left until after achieving tenure.},

Real life does not distinguish as clearly as Kloor attempts to do between scientific and ideological considerations. The article by Roger Pielke in \emph{FiveThirtyEight}, which Kloor discusses at length, certainly attracted ideological responses, but it was also widely criticized on scientific grounds. Pielke and his critics, such as William Nordhaus, have published arguments for and against in peer-reviewed journals. For those who sincerely believe that someone's methods are deeply flawed and his or her conclusions factually incorrect, it is not an act of censorship, but of responsible peer review or journalism to not print that work.

    and converted to densely inhabited, agricultural islands (i.e., polders). This landscape is juxtaposed to the adjacent
    Sundarbans, a pristine mangrove forest, both well connected by a dense network of tidal channels that effectively convey
    water and sediment throughout the region. The extensive embanking in poldered areas, however, has greatly reduced the
    tidal prism (i.e., volume of water) transported through local channels. We reveal that $>600~\text{km}$ of these major
    waterways have infilled in recent decades, converting to land through enhanced sedimentation and the direct blocking of
    waterways by embankments and sluice gates. Nearly all of the observed closures ($\sim 98\%$) have occurred along the
    embanked polder systems, with no comparable changes occurring in channels of the Sundarbans ($<2\%$ change). We attribute
    most of the channel infilling to the local reduction of tidal prism in poldered areas and the associated decline in
    current velocities. The infilled channels account for $\sim 90~\text{km}^2$ of new land in the last 40--50 years, the rate
    of which, $\sim 2~\text{km}^2/\text{yr}$, offsets the $4~\text{km}^2/\text{yr}$ that is eroded at the coast, and is
    equivalent to $\sim 20\%$ of the new land produced naturally at the Ganges-Brahmaputra tidal rivermouth. Most of this new land,
    called `khas' in Bengali, has been reclaimed for agriculture or aquaculture, contributing to the local economy. However,
    benefits are tempered by the loss of navigable waterways for commerce, transportation, and fishing, as well as the forced
    rerouting of tidal waters and sediments necessary to sustain this low-lying landscape against rising sea level. A more
    sustainable delta will require detailed knowledge of the consequences of these hydrodynamic changes to support more

Residents in the study area use groundwater far less than the national average; salinity and local rainwater scarcity necessitates the use of multiple water sources throughout the year. Groundwater concentrations of arsenic and specific conductivity (SpC) were greater than surface water (pond) concentrations; there was no statistically significant seasonal difference in mean concentrations in groundwater, but there was for ponds, with arsenic higher in the dry season. Average arsenic concentrations in local water drinking were 2--4 times times the national average. All of the local groundwater samples exceeded the Bangladesh guidance for SpC, although the majority of residents surveyed did not perceive their water as having a ``bad'' or ``salty'' taste.},

  abstract     = {Drought and water scarcity are growing challenges to agriculture around the world. Farmers can adapt through both individual and community-based collective actions. We draw on extensive field-work conducted with paddy farmers in rural Sri Lanka to study adaptations to water scarcity, including switching to less water-intensive crops, farming collectively on shared land, and individually turning to groundwater by digging wells. We explore how variability in climate affects agricultural decision-making at the community and individual levels using three types of decision-making, each characterized by an objective function: risk-averse expected utility, regret-adjusted expected utility, and prospect theory loss-aversion. We also assess how the introduction of individualized access to irrigation water with wells affects community-based drought mitigation practices. Preliminary results suggest that the growth of well-irrigation may produce sudden disruptions to community-based adaptations, but that this depends on the mental models farmers use to think about risk and make decisions under uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {Droughts affect more people than any other natural disaster. Drought severity is not merely a function of precipitation; it emerges from a web of interrelations between human and natural systems. The impacts of drought are equally complex, shifting across temporal scales, economic sectors, and regions. Even in regions with similar hydroclimatic characteristics, there is tremendous variation in the effects of drought. This study combines satellite imagery, geospatial data, and qualitative data to identify the multi-scalar factors that drive variations in agricultural responses to drought. We analyzed eleven years of remotely sensed imagery to identify agricultural areas in which cultivation occurred during an extreme drought in Sri Lanka. We visited a subset of these communities and conducted interviews with officials and farmers to identify the factors that influenced agricultural adaptation. Results suggest that though structural factors such as infrastructural capacity and physical environment significantly affect agricultural adaptation, dynamic factors such as local control of water supply, perceived risk, community cohesion, and farmer experience explain significant variation in the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems.},

significantly more predictive power on held-out datasets than a baseline.
Though the tool was built to increase capacity to monitor vegetation health in
data scarce regions like South Asia, users may include ancillary spatiotemporal
datasets relevant to their region of interest to increase predictive power and to
facilitate interpretation of model results. The tool can automatically update
predictions as new MODIS data is made available by NASA. The tool is

between the Northeastern monsoon and El-Ni\~no in recent decades. Correlation analysis with agricultural metrics suggests that different indices might be appropriate for

political conflicts play an important role in the transition of water-supply regimes
toward higher levels of demandreduction policies and programs. Qualitative analysis
using institutional theory identifies the interaction of four types of motivating
logics---development, rural preservation, environmental, and urban consumer---and
shows how demand-reduction strategies can potentially satisfy all four. Quantitative
analysis of the explanatory factors for the variation in the adoption of demand-reduction
policies points to the overwhelming importance of political preferences as defined by
Cook's Partisan Voting Index. We suggest that approaches to water-supply choices are
influenced less by direct partisan disagreements than by broad preferences for a
development logic based on supplyincrease strategies and discomfort with
demand-reduction strategies that clash with conservative beliefs.},

We conduct sensitivity analyses to determine how a variety of factors describing both the market and the physical climate may affect traders' beliefs about the cause of global climate change.

and a vast, low-lying coastal plain, is perceived to be at great
risk of increased flooding and submergence from sea-level
rise. However, human alteration of the landscape can
create similar risks to sea-level rise. Here, we report that
islands in southwest Bangladesh, enclosed by embankments
in the 1960s, have lost 1.0--1.5m of elevation, whereas
the neighbouring Sundarban mangrove forest has remained
comparatively stable. We attribute this elevation loss
to interruption of sedimentation inside the embankments,
combined with accelerated compaction, removal of forest
biomass, and a regionally increased tidal range. One major
consequence of this elevation loss occurred in 2009 when the
embankments of several large islands failed during Cyclone
Aila, leaving large areas of land tidally inundated for up
to two years until embankments were repaired. Despite
sustained human suering during this time, the newly
reconnected landscape received tens of centimetres of tidally
deposited sediment, equivalent to decades' worth of normal
sedimentation. Although many areas still lie well below mean
high water and remain at risk of severe flooding, we conclude
that elevation recovery may be possible through controlled
embankment breaches.},

  abstract     = {Cities across the world have had to diversify and expand their water supply systems in response to demand growth, groundwater depletion and pollution, and instability and inadequacy of regional surface freshwater sources. In the U.S., these problems plague not only the arid Western cities but increasingly also cities in the Eastern portions of the country. Although cities continue to seek out new sources of water via Promethean projects of long-distance supply systems, desalinization plants, and the recharge of aquifers with surface water, they also pursue water conservation because of its low cost and other benefits. We examine water conservation as a complex sociotechnical system comprising interactions of political, sociodemographic, economic, and hydroclimatological factors. We provide quantitative data on the factors that affect more and less advanced transitions in water conservation regimes, and we show that water stress and other hydrological data can only partially predict the transition. We also provide qualitative case studies to identify institutional and political barriers to more advanced water conservation regimes. This interdisciplinary, mixed methods approach typifies the need for knowledge that informs hydrologists about how their research may or may not be adopted by decision-makers.},

have strong predictive power and are interpretable in human terms. This is useful for designing empirically
grounded agent-based simulations and for gaining direct insight into observed dynamic processes. We
use an efficient model representation and a genetic algorithm-based estimation process to generate simple
approximations that explain most of the structure of complex stochastic processes. This method, implemented
in C\textsuperscript{++} and R, scales well to large data sets. We apply our methods to empirical data from human subjects
game experiments and international relations. We also demonstrate the method's ability to recover known
data-generating processes by simulating data with agent-based models and correctly deriving the underlying
decision models for multiple agent models and degrees of stochasticity.},

A carbon price---whether in the form of a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade program---is the optimal government response but is unlikely to be implemented within the next decade. Likely government policies will reduce emissions by far less than needed to reduce the risk of significant climate disruption, but recent corporate carbon disclosure programs, supply chain contracting requirements, investor pressure, and other private initiatives demonstrate the viability of another approach. Private initiatives can reduce carbon emissions without the coercive power or resources of government by correcting market and behavioral failures and by drawing on the support for mitigation that exists in a subset of the population. The Article demonstrates how a private governance wedge of emissions reductions can be achieved by expanding current corporate and household private governance initiatives and by launching new initiatives that address climate beliefs, motivations, and behavior. Private initiatives can bypass ideological barriers and national boundaries, but implementing a private climate governance strategy will require relaxing the assumption that only governments can drive major emissions reductions over the next decade.},

  abstract     = {This Essay argues for consideration of political opportunity costs in the criteria used to evaluate climate policy instruments. Law and policy debates typically evaluate policy instruments by their expected performance after adoption, tacitly excluding consideration of the timing of adoption. Under this standard, a comprehensive carbon pricing instrument, either in the form of a cap and trade program or a carbon tax, has emerged as the preferred approach. Yet by excluding the political process from consideration, this standard obscures the effects of political feasibility on the timing of adoption. For many problems, the advantages of an optimal policy outweigh the advantages of a sub-optimal one that will require less time and effort to adopt. The climate problem is different: the irreversibility of climate change, the possibility of tipping points in the climate system, and lag times in infrastructure investments combine to impose large costs on delay. Excluding political opportunity costs from instrument evaluation leads to a preference for slow, comprehensive remedies. The casualties in this process are incremental instruments that could buy time, facilitate the adoption of additional instruments, and complement those instruments after they are adopted. This Essay proposes explicit consideration of political opportunity costs in evaluating climate policy instruments and applies this approach to several leading climate policies.},

  abstract     = {Much of energy policy is driven by concerns about climate change. Views about the importance of carbon emissions affect debates on topics ranging from the regulation of electricity generation and transmission to the need for incentives to develop and promote emerging technologies. Government efforts to fund and communicate climate science have been extraordinary, but recent polling suggests that roughly half of the American population is unsure or does not believe that anthropogenic climate change is occurring. Among some populations belief in climate change is declining even as the climate science becomes more certain. Much of the doubt occurs among individuals who support free markets, and the doubt is fueled by the argument that governments and government-funded climate scientists are not accounting for information that is inconsistent with the climate consensus. This Article explores a private governance response: the creation of a prediction market to assess and communicate the implications of climate science. Markets not only allow the buying and selling of goods, they provide information about the likelihood of future events. Research suggests that markets are often able to account for information that is outside of the conventional wisdom. In addition, individuals who are likely to doubt climate science may find markets to be credible sources of information. A climate market could take the form of an academic initiative along the lines of the Iowa presidential prediction market or could operate as a more traditional options market. Trading could occur over the types of predictions that matter for global climate change, such as the global average temperature or sea level in 2020 or 2100, with the current market value of the prediction signaling the likelihood of the outcome. The market will be subject to manipulation concerns, but experience with other prediction markets suggests that a climate prediction market has the potential to provide an accurate, credible and widely-disseminated signal about the status of the climate science.},

Translating policy goals into effective action requires understanding these interactions at multiple levels.

  abstract     = {The individual and household sector accounts for roughly 40 percent of United States energy use and carbon dioxide emissions, yet the laws and policies directed at reductions from this sector often reflect a remarkably simplistic model of behavior. This Essay addresses one of the obstacles to achieving a ``behavioral wedge'' of individual and household emissions reductions: the lack of an accessible, brief summary for policymakers of the key findings of behavioral and social science studies on household energy behavior. The Essay does not provide a comprehensive overview of the field, but it discusses many of the leading studies that demonstrate the extent and limits of rational action. These studies can inform lawyers and policymakers who are developing measures to reduce energy use and carbon emissions and can serve as an entry point for more detailed studies of the literature.

An effective response to the climate change problem will require substantial reductions in energy demand in addition to new developments in low-carbon energy supplies. The individual and household sector presents a major opportunity: the sector accounts for roughly 40\% of U.S. carbon emissions and a comparable percentage of total U.S. energy production, and it is one of the most promising areas for reducing emissions. A recent analysis estimates that behavioral measures directed at this sector could reasonably be expected to reduce total US emissions by over 7\% by 2020, an amount larger than the combined emissions from several of the largest-emitting industrial sectors and larger than the total emissions of France. In many cases, these emissions reductions can be achieved at less cost than the leading alternatives.

Despite this opportunity, recent regulatory and policy efforts are only beginning to direct substantial attention to the individual and household sector. Findings from the social sciences provide valuable insights into how to capitalize on this opportunity, yet policymakers often have little time to develop new polices and are confronted with a barrage of often-conflicting approaches and theories. This Essay addresses the policy-making challenge by distilling the findings from a broad range of fields into several key principles for those developing energy and climate laws and policies. The principles we outline here are a starting point for policymakers working in this area. We attempt to provide insight into which principles are most relevant to law and policy, but instructions as to how to incorporate these principles are beyond the scope of this essay. The principles include only a subset of the insights from the behavioral and social science literature. In many cases, adherence to multiple principles will be necessary to develop the most effective policy design. Policymakers should consult the body of work referenced here, as well as experts in the social sciences to further their understanding of these and other principles. More extensive reviews of this literature and its relevance to energy and climate policy are also available.},

  abstract     = {In his book about the financial crisis that led to the so-called ``Great Recession,'' Michael Lewis tells the story of Michael Burry,
a short-seller who realized that many subprime mortgage bonds were worthless if the inevitable happened---if home prices leveled off.
Home prices did not need to actually fall for the financial meltdown to occur; they simply needed to level off.
Models that valued subprime home loan-based derivatives did not reveal the extent of the risk because
the models could not account for stable or falling home prices.
Burry assumed that once this information became widespread, the market for these risky derivatives would collapse.
To his surprise, even when the insight was widely shared, the party continued for years.
By then, many individuals and institutions were too heavily invested in not seeing that the emperor had no clothes to change
course before the meltdown began.

We had a reaction similar to Burry's the first time we read one of Harvard economist Martin Weitzman's articles on the failure to
include fat tailed risks in the leading integrated assessment models (IAMs) of climate change costs and benefits.
The aspect of climate change most worthy of substantial attention by anyone interested in rational risk regulation
is the existence of catastrophic, irreversible outcomes.
Small shifts in rainfall or temperature may or may not be worthy of regulatory expenditures, but they do not pose core,
long-term threats.
Peer-reviewed publications by paleoclimatologists and climate scientists suggest, however, that there are disturbingly high
likelihoods of temperature increases and sea level rises that could cause the kinds of systemic failures that almost brought
down the financial system in 2008.},

However, achieving it will in part require sophisticated energy efficiency and conservation programs. To overcome institutional and behavioral barriers, these programs will need to implement six principles of effective design derived from 30 years of behavioral and social science research. We focus on the household sector, but believe our general conclusions likely apply to other sectors as well.},

We use a behavioral approach to examine the reasonably achievable potential for near-term reductions by altered adoption and use of available technologies in US homes and nonbusiness travel. We estimate the plasticity of 17 household action types in 5 behaviorally distinct categories by use of data on the most effective documented interventions that do not involve new regulatory measures. These interventions vary by type of action and typically combine several policy tools and strong social marketing. National implementation could save an estimated 123 million metric tons of carbon per year in year 10, which is 20\% of household direct emissions or 7.4\% of US national emissions, with little or no reduction in household well-being. The potential of household action deserves increased policy attention. Future analyses of this potential should incorporate behavioral as well as economic and engineering elements.},

Given the growing emphasis on simultaneous imaging of more than one cardiac variable, we present an analysis of the potential of dual camera imaging, using as an example our straightforward dual camera system that allows simultaneous measurement of two dynamic quantities from the same region of the heart. The advantages of our system over others include an optional software camera calibration routine that eliminates the need for precise camera alignment. The system allows for rapid setup, dichroic image separation, dual-rate imaging, and high spatial resolution, and it is generally applicable to any two-camera measurement. This type of imaging system offers the potential for recording simultaneously not only transmembrane potential and intracellular calcium, two frequently measured quantities, but also other signals more directly related to myocardial metabolism, such as [K+]e, NADH, and reactive oxygen species, leading to the possibility of correlative multimodal cardiac imaging. We provide a compilation of dye and camera information critical to the design of dual camera systems and experiments.},

Yet the assumption that only extensive government regulation will generate substantial reductions from the sector is a barrier to change, particularly in a political environment hostile to regulation. This Article demonstrates that prompt and large reductions can be achieved without relying predominantly on regulatory measures. The Article identifies seven ``low-hanging fruit:'' actions that have the potential to achieve large reductions at less than half the cost of the leading current federal legislation, require limited up-front government expenditures, generate net savings for the individual, and do not confront other barriers. The seven actions discussed in this Article not only meet these criteria, but also will generate roughly 150 million tons in emissions reductions and several billion dollars in net social savings. The Article concludes that the actions identified here are only a beginning, and it identifies changes that will be necessary by policymakers and academicians if these and other low-hanging fruit are to be picked.},

2.2~to 8.5~$\mu$m. Attenuated total reflectance (ATR) Fourier-transform~IR~(FTIR) spectroscopy is used to examine infrared tissue absorption spectra before and after irradiation. Light scattering by bovine and porcine cartilage and cornea samples is measured in real time during FEL irradiation using a 650-nm diode laser and a diode photoarray with time resolution of 10~ms. The data on the time dependence of light scattering in the tissue are modeled to estimate the approximate values of kinetic parameters for denaturation as functions of laser wavelength and radiant exposure. We found that the denaturation threshold is slightly lower for cornea than for cartilage, and both depend on laser wavelength. An inverse correlation between denaturation thresholds and the absorption spectrum of the tissue is observed for many wavelengths; however, for wavelengths near 3~and 6~$\mu$m, the denaturation threshold does not exhibit the inverse correlation, instead being governed by heating kinetics of tissue. It is shown that light scattering is useful for measuring the denaturation thresholds and dynamics for different biotissues, except where the initial absorptivity is very high.},
